It reduces on how often parts check rather they need to update(Set this to your monitors refresh rate I'd say, so it checks for example 60 times per second rather the scoreboard changed, and only renders when it's actually different. Before it checked each frame which was too often)\r\n* Update MixinExtras to 0.2.0-rc.2\r\n* Fix hanging sign text rendering a block too low\r\n* Fix config reset button not actually working(just visually)\r\n* Update tablist on heart blink and username style change by @JustAlittleWolf in https://github.com/tr7zw/Exordium/pull/99\r\n* Added a small text to the config screen to remind people that [supporting the dev is an option](https://tr7zw.dev/donate/) 😇\r\n\r\n## Known issues, please don't report/ask:\r\n* Nametag buffering is still broken\r\n* Mod UI elements like minimaps are not buffered(Neither on NeoForged or Fabric)\r\n* The better F3 slide-in animation is bound to the update rate, so it is laggy\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/Exordium/compare/1.1.4-1.20.1...1.2.1-1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-08T11:25:55.835190Z","downloads":25221,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4e905da34fca10f2d263c05103966727e127bf32","sha512":"e27a8ea01478c8c8d2d101ae567b6c708da1b6ff932fb1840922c518f2e918dc8182b4e5220d71ea0155063b030cd2f82818a320fce33f2f1eeed6a512641b45"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DynYZEae/versions/fROHV9gC/exordium-fabric-1.2.1-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"exordium-fabric-1.2.1-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":324389,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"VTZ6EyAv","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"exordium-fabric-1.2.1-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\ImmersiveThunder-1.20.1+1.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"ce0cd41920d3f2c70ea46216fedbd329b844fd9b8df104b4c1a14b0476606e18fc5697fc27e7b5025ba98494a5c628649d66d755308ecc6297f62089c93732d3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uKjKoMsj","slug":"immersivethunder","project_type":"mod","team":"9K9AOVvU","title":"ImmersiveThunder","description":"A fabric mod that adds realistic and dynamic thunder sounds to Minecraft based on the player’s distance from the lightning strike.","body":"# ImmersiveThunder\n\nImmersiveThunder adds new thunder sounds to the game and plays them dynamically based on the player’s distance from the source.

Its main focus lies in reducing the lag caused by redstone dust, by optimizing the power calculations and reducing the number of shape and block updates emitted. As a side effect of these changes the block update order of redstone dust networks is predictable and intuitive rather than locational and chaotic.\n\n### Performance\n\nMSPT contributions of redstone dust are up to 20 times lower with Alternate Current, all the while maintaining a high level of Vanilla parity. Its low number of code modifications make it minimally invasive, so it's an easy drop-in replacement for Vanilla redstone dust.\n\nCheck out the [GitHub page](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current/blob/main/README.md) for a detailed explanation of Alternate Current's improvements.\n\n## Why is redstone dust so laggy?\n\nThere are two main reasons why redstone dust is laggy: unnecessary updates and unnecessary calculations, both of which are caused by the fact that redstone dust updates recursively. A redstone wire can update its power level over half a dozen times before settling on the final value, doing expensive calculations and emitting copious amounts of shape and block updates each time. On top of that, many shape and block updates are completely redundant. \n\n## How does Alternate Current fix that?\n\nAlternate Current fixes these issues by doing power calculations of the entire network before updating the power levels. Each wire will check power from non-wire components just once and power from other wires just twice. Power sources within the network are identified, and the power is spread from there. This makes the calculations more efficient and the update order more intuitive. Shape and block updates are only emitted when the final power level is reached, and each wire emits no redundant updates.","published":"2021-04-05T18:22:08.996630Z","updated":"2023-08-25T14:51:41.534774Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":81517,"followers":590,"categories":["optimization","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.0","1.1","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.3","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.5","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.7","1.7.1","1.7.10","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.7.4","1.7.5","1.7.6","1.7.7","1.7.8","1.7.9","1.8","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","1.9.4","a1.0.11","a1.0.14","a1.0.15","a1.0.16","a1.0.17_02","a1.0.17_04","a1.1.0","a1.1.2","a1.1.2_01","a1.2.0","a1.2.0_01","a1.2.0_02","a1.2.1","a1.2.1_01","a1.2.2a","a1.2.2b","a1.2.3","a1.2.3_01","a1.2.3_02","a1.2.3_04","a1.2.4_01","a1.2.5","a1.2.6","b1.0","b1.0_01","b1.0.2","b1.1_01","b1.1_02","b1.2","b1.2_01","b1.2_02","b1.3_01","b1.3b","b1.4","b1.4_01","b1.5","b1.5_01","b1.6","b1.6.1","b1.6.2","b1.6.3","b1.6.4","b1.6.5","b1.6.6","b1.7","b1.7.2","b1.7.3","b1.8","b1.8.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["O3ymAMEH","oX2SAJg0","Wcg8QtlB","Ca2crPBC","rdScmQX2","z78WRI0B","CSFStoYN","JZErTOBa","9uewQm0i","1ebDeupo","5OYFZNQb","gKNMWQFe","qZQ7ath8","eKThDBxV","fIgfufLA","MbEV8ysu","oaPAZHeF","30P7c8Sc","cnm8f9GG","N3bxgXDH","DDiRJszQ","GiAWvJK9","LynxUXOP","9F6atBKt","GwY5IFEy","9SXtCwu0","t5DWN1gm","G27JrgiI","HhzkvE6O","N8AvvTfs","DS5ILIxG","txTm74H4","ZF4E7jII","XyChhmMe","sYu2D6ez","MLH4H0y2","2DSIjEoj","emgpmBBm","lQpWSj6j","yQIu276H","XQit89EZ","5vr2yCCO","S4dJ2iyh","1I4OWQil","VWU16jcy","FV0dyi7m","gUosQHld","4QElEqe4","NzZe7tXs","gxfBnR7p","T52JhWsT","cGXi6arS","vettdZX4","u8zKAKt8","ER3cM1dr","F0ROppUm","r0y55em7","xapZdXkF","8NEwN8KM","xPdjvwwA","BvQnpyPj","VkwuA8t1","4nKkKsjy","L6nyX2yD","v9lKbHW6","bVYFJbvx","W78bVcwe","MzCxRhC6","JyMccsNd","jYQUIR7B","FkanfPQt","zrRsTCOk","oUiJaPJ4","otRJ7qRt","ScVaodC7","jeBtGGPj","GHvIXuaf","qmLJQdlV","APKbnFb7","yeEKF5Cu","Y5Q8sEjA","dxOkiCsx","8sC1JfwZ","bM8opJlV","BjloWltb","F7ERk3df","4SkLYef2","kC6SY4Zp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/r0v8vy1s/fbb5a094676807df4b5ca1686033d5eb5fc389fd.png"},"version":{"id":"zrRsTCOk","project_id":"r0v8vy1s","author_id":"f6Ry7Czx","featured":false,"name":"[1.20 Fabric] Alternate Current 1.7.0","version_number":"mc1.20-1.7.0","changelog":"# 1.7.0\n\n- Fixes a duplication bug introduced in v1.6.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-25T20:41:57.667614Z","downloads":15744,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4136198cbd1ee00e906f33fc533e10a9324fc2b9","sha512":"10355abdedd8f23c3ad7afa2268988dbce90306c807ab1076f6103f2263dcaad8323b356d76e585910ed6acd0226dc4031e681462524ed4c4c8c0a3564042619"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/r0v8vy1s/versions/zrRsTCOk/alternate-current-mc1.20-1.7.0.jar","filename":"alternate-current-mc1.20-1.7.0.jar","primary":true,"size":38501,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ICk2lOk1","user":{"id":"f6Ry7Czx","username":"Space Walker","name":"Space Walker","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48224626?v=4","bio":"Redstoner, modder","created":"2021-02-27T19:02:49.428839Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"alternate-current-mc1.20-1.7.0.jar"},"mods\\EasyAnvils-v8.0.1-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"3421192d0cc904058b7650fe1ddebc717f0739dd164486c2a92f49b7513a8987951a9afd514258ce07e87ff4e81fb1b93aef947633a61c125d548ff65080e96c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OZBR5JT5","slug":"easy-anvils","project_type":"mod","team":"vvhQP5TS","title":"Easy Anvils","description":"Be ready for overhauled anvils!

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name.

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

for minecraft versions 1.18 and later (not including snapshots).\n\nThe documentation is being written. Until then, here's the overview of the APIs in LiLaC you as a developer can use:\n\n* Resource loader - a wrapper around Minecraft's asynchronous Resource Loader API ([Fabric docs](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:resource)). Support will be added for Minecraft versions back until 1.18\n* A codec for [VersionPredicate](https://maven.fabricmc.net/docs/fabric-loader-0.14.22/net/fabricmc/loader/api/metadata/version/VersionPredicate.html) in Fabric Loader API\n* `fabric.mod.json` custom metadata deserializer (and serializer)\n* Some Minecraft Registry lookup API\n* A wrapper for game tick\n\nSome planned APIs:\n\n* A wrapper for [DrawContext](https://maven.fabricmc.net/docs/yarn-1.20+build.1/net/minecraft/client/gui/DrawContext.html) (Minecraft 1.20+) and its predecessor, [DrawableHelper](https://maven.fabricmc.net/docs/yarn-1.19.4+build.2/net/minecraft/client/gui/DrawableHelper.html)\n* A wrapper for [Toast](https://maven.fabricmc.net/docs/yarn-1.20+build.1/net/minecraft/client/toast/Toast.html) (because of DrawContext)","published":"2023-07-21T12:57:04.299132Z","updated":"2023-09-24T16:46:39.774813Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":25830,"followers":25,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["R0Clyo73","pRI9PPjm","UuwX5TxU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Rtp2Lyr5/f480c3c71419038505ffa0694917ee79742f4f14.png"},"version":{"id":"UuwX5TxU","project_id":"Rtp2Lyr5","author_id":"PpKojnYx","featured":false,"name":"LiLaC 1.0.0-beta.3","version_number":"1.0.0-beta.3","changelog":"# LiLaC 1.0.0-beta.3\n\n## What's new since 1.0.0-beta.2\n\n* Added support for Minecraft 1.20.2\n* Added API to create DataResult in DFU (got upgraded with Minecraft 1.20.2, and introduced a breaking change)\n\n## About this release\n\n* Last 1.0.0 beta\n* The next version will be 1.0.1-beta.1\n  * Not all planned Minecraft versions are supported yet\n  * To properly test older versions using OptiGUI, new APIs needed by OptiGUI will be added\n\n## Recommendations\n\n* This is a snapshot release before adding support for older Minecraft versions\n* OptiGUI will depend on the next version, and not on this\n* Documentation is available on [GitHub Pages](https://opekope2.github.io/LiLaC)\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-24T16:46:42.148879Z","downloads":19576,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"2e2c94fb9b349fc7b2de5e76c79f0199589d8b9ffc472c3cd8725d4ef6a67396d45b77606d6a5b114b318c759b3b1a834ee1603ca59155c5d141843a18d0ab66","sha1":"e6d449b82261294fd36dd8059d78c521f30cc08d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Rtp2Lyr5/versions/UuwX5TxU/lilac-1.0.0-beta.3.jar","filename":"lilac-1.0.0-beta.3.jar","primary":true,"size":88101,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"e256f5e082d365bff3e83336df01823f0ed080392e10f6faa46b59bb58eb1d691b038afc0d3eb50dd91ecaedeac930898f5b06003d69e886a15b8b27e0f6fd9c","sha1":"c7f312a1d2888e84305e729da1c01a6db6197be0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Rtp2Lyr5/versions/UuwX5TxU/lilac-1.0.0-beta.3-api.jar","filename":"lilac-1.0.0-beta.3-api.jar","primary":false,"size":28477,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"8632e0a16aeadb2520437001582ddd1c2a5abfa6695d6b63a81c44bcfe2dbfe1ca1f592bd7eddfafbe058078d62cdedaff74b543244ea9e46401c6549fbe8659","sha1":"b1ee79e333955c16c81d0382a0a1d5245e39644c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Rtp2Lyr5/versions/UuwX5TxU/lilac-1.0.0-beta.3-sources.jar","filename":"lilac-1.0.0-beta.3-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":37333,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Lz0Rg3gL","user":{"id":"PpKojnYx","username":"opekope2","name":"opekope2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20487556?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-02T09:42:18.771673Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lilac-1.0.0-beta.3.jar"},"mods\\memoryleakfix-fabric-1.17+-1.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"a921d171d4391a690724cde818d43f666b03a36e1ffa05849c2c853f6e005f6fc4254f1bc040890a0a8a6eff57abf2edf73367189bb2ec9e34e9df92920d89ad","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NRjRiSSD","slug":"memoryleakfix","project_type":"mod","team":"PxfoVTFT","title":"Memory Leak Fix","description":"A mod that fixes random memory leaks for both the client and server","body":"# memoryLeakFix\n### A mod that fixes multiple memory leaks in Minecraft.

takes Minecraft's 1.18 massive world generation overhaul, and turns it up to eleven.\n\n![terralith_banner_squashed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224816673-7f074733-da85-4673-a7b0-3362651c4dbd.png)\n\n## Notes\n- Terralith is *technically* compatible with William Wyther's Overhauled Overworld, Biomes O' Plenty, and Oh The Biomes You'll Go; but it requires Terrablender, which screws with the biome distribution\n- Terralith is compatible with Tectonic, if you use [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloDatapacks)'s [Terratonic](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terratonic/)\n- Do not add this to an existing world - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\n### Biomes\nTerralith adds over 95 brand new biomes, as well as updating almost every vanilla biome with new and improved features. There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-10-01T16:41:24.293773Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":202563,"followers":886,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"qFd4s3fV","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.4.7 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"2.4.7","changelog":"# Terralith v2.4.7\nSpecial thanks to Apollo for spending the time on this massive backend update!\n\n- Large internal cleanup.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-09-22T17:07:54.581205Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2200419,"followers":3248,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BDwHAdWc","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:08:01.300588Z","downloads":228135,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8e4be2bb9703deddb3d3d212c812cdc1f9de072b","sha512":"0080d3733f77e6b2e80e40d5d7bfe63dd125d94984bf92568d3434ff281f68123ec382ee53eba021278c01059299c12492dd518e61de1247f5cf7e8040bc98f1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/BDwHAdWc/entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":59348,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\blanket-client-tweaks-1.1.4.jar":{"sha512":"2643e683610d4a81c7c8ca19ed6ce995cb8395fdf900dcd4a850b427634e15e4c7d189676e2d98fe4e678fa725c23210a7f528a986ea7c7eba3f7d534b791a86","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gxpkKtVH","slug":"blanket","project_type":"mod","team":"sSCnH8Kr","title":"Blanket","description":"Minecraft Client-fixes/tweaks","body":"# Blanket client-tweaks\n\n**Blanket** is aiming to fix many client-side bugs, also has some QoL improvements and tweaks  \n\n## Everything is configurable \nGo into mod settings, and configure everything!

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":323435,"followers":997,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"m0Dd8Cjy","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+ Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:37:15.141667Z","downloads":86556,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"04f017920be9e982c945df0d27ef93a4cace730b7bc6fd46a82c028c50f7d6819ec0a4c28a4454bc681b4591eeddb08b74c330cb577d7a697a2391fcc11d925d","sha1":"21ae6dd81324543e77c10bbb2b928320d71b6750"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":77342,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"3bb877f7683b45ff74c5e507aa3c3d263ca3b898eaef58f39c7681cff26cc8a34fbdabb65e9ad46b72c001b2cc8293dc7e02f9f6e26399e008ba4f85833ebebb","sha1":"a54dee75a5447fe29ab0d1b9f2f6a64c9531337f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"mods\\PuzzlesLib-v8.0.24-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"f8cd5cfc5eb50cd2196adcf06062867edb2034fa47d39a8665ed28531e66b3ca6aefe177d96f4f7a035ae9b59fc7407800393ee15db3193eb6e30b7741e27607","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"QAGBst4M","slug":"puzzles-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"ubZOU9rM","title":"Puzzles Lib","description":"Why's it called Puzzles you ask?

It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium.

This mod is entirely client-side, meaning anyone with or without the mod will see the modifications done by it. It only takes advantages of hidden vanilla features and exposes them to the users without doing any breaking changes.\n\nQ: Can I use your mod in/for my modpack/datapack?  \nA: Please do! A credit would be appreciated in your modlist.  \nSimply do not appropriate yourself this mod.\n\nQ: Will this mod ever come to Forge?  \nA: No! This mod is intended to push a little forward the Fabric community, and this is my choice to explicitly not make it available to another mod loader for the time being.  \nHowever, [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/waffle-stomper/Ghostwriter) is a solid alternative for Forge and the book editing part.\n\nQ: Where can I find the source code of the project?  \nA: As of now, nowhere. This project has been a precious opportunity to make myself comfortable again with Java and a good learning process for modding, as much as I would love some help and see how people could contribute in amazing ways, I still want to practice and learn more for future mods.  \nI don't exclude opening the source code later down the line!\n\nQ: Why is your mod named \"Stendhal\"?  \nA: Glad you are wondering! Marie-Henri Stendhal was a renowned French writer born in the 19th century in my hometown in France.\n</details>\n\n## ❤ Upcoming Updates ❤\n\nStendhal is being actively developed and ported to newer Minecraft versions over time.\n\n> **If you would like to give suggestion and follow the development more actively, please join [my Discord Community]**\n\n## ❤ Community ❤\n\nYou can join me on [my Discord Community] to discuss about Stendhal alongside my various projects, whether they are linked to Minecraft modding or not!\n\nIf you would like, feel free to support me on [Ko-Fi], it would make me really happy and motivated!\n\n[![Support me on Ko-Fi!](https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=2)][Ko-Fi]\n\n[my Discord Community]: https://discord.gg/6StChT5m2V\n[Ko-Fi]: https://ko-fi.com/nebspacefarer\n","published":"2021-04-03T13:00:28.570722Z","updated":"2023-10-22T13:03:23.488093Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":174813,"followers":462,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7RZcMviG","6HUcDuYC","FgDI6kIz","ZBI5qTep","tzYc9HNM","mctIoo5p","GegFEZ3h","cSzSbcvJ","FPGndHr3","YzKB2i5W","MAruo7Ba","DRpka5gO","5OcCVJdV","YYMS9LcJ","WEzwowSz","fAaHFHVp","NriKkvat","LUHS9aJ0","apwqGSaK","Vf7GPVNV","XBrcSt3S"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BWloQ9jK/5038b0062081cc4af94eb4dcfdcd2615fa6cbf2f.png"},"version":{"id":"Vf7GPVNV","project_id":"BWloQ9jK","author_id":"TXl4HOmY","featured":true,"name":"Stendhal 1.4.0 - Fabric 1.20->1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.0-1.20","changelog":"> 🪧 **Sign Editor Screen:** Fixed Saving and Loading Signs by prompting a new confirmation screen on loading.\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T12:56:23.027888Z","downloads":1131,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ccbfd05ba7d65de3d46fe1985b5da742bf143aa7f0cbfa487a79b5d440e11963986a32273d25a42e0d682aa8b9350588dcd2b27f243d06fae00d4e474c59df27","sha1":"860b4f5a8cfbe7f8e4f970a8374bd90db7e4b71f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BWloQ9jK/versions/Vf7GPVNV/stendhal-1.4.0-1.20.jar","filename":"stendhal-1.4.0-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":511087,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"P35VUUuy","user":{"id":"TXl4HOmY","username":"NebSpacefarer","name":"NebSpacefarer","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65596181?v=4","bio":"Developer of 📚 Stendhal\n- 🔢 Usage Ticker\n- ♻️ Quick Player Trade","created":"2021-04-03T12:14:34.541276Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"stendhal-1.4.0-1.20.jar"},"mods\\screenshot-to-clipboard-1.0.9-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"d74c132c4d4f77019edf6e1b7d522cea78ec78a17c96bd04290ab1df5caf37b6fe7d94069afffd385750d257ffe427ece55f13137ee765ec1a56ec255d389812","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1KiJRrTg","slug":"screenshot-to-clipboard","project_type":"mod","team":"qyt4SwA9","title":"Screenshot to Clipboard","description":"Screenshots taken are copied to the clipboard.","body":"Any time you take a screenshot in the game, the image data is copied to the clipboard.

setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for

Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n#### Translators\nLanguages in alphabetical order\n\n- [神枪968](https://github.com/GodGun968) - 简体中文 / Chinese (Simplified)\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - English (United Kingdom)\n- [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) - eesti keel / Estonian\n- [co-91](https://github.com/co-91) - 日本語 / Japanese\n- [Rodrigo Appelt](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Português / Portuguese\n- [SyberiaK](https://github.com/SyberiaK) - Русский / Russian\n- [Felix14-v2](https://github.com/Felix14-v2) - Русский / Russian\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (mexicano) / Spanish (Mexico)\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (españa) / Spanish (Spain)\n- [localfossa](https://github.com/localfossa) - Türkçe / Turkish\n- [Im Vietnam](https://github.com/ImVietnam) - Tiếng Việt / Vietnamese\n","published":"2022-01-29T20:52:18.744493Z","updated":"2023-09-28T15:35:33.190866Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":755282,"followers":1574,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["iVw60IvO","cgp0M9ZD","gUBtDUBp","4Kmn0eeU","p4qDdICN","87tTbECt","Z7VJkXXa","2ZC7Fxc8","jfoKe5Fr","HDVevQGA","Dqby42rh","ywAz0NBY","LropUbSI","yRrEHsQ0","qJLT1UZa","t2MUOMy5","IjbCI21q","ClfJLhWu","ssxmDm4w","3bwXGtwH","vdNR7RSe","VqJlUKUp","BrGdvUUq","zS4oS6ht","sC6H3PnU","TQKBOZaT","nls01OIv","f017okM4","YHh8fxDi","p5RjeOJL","mIiMyney","1mKrqlvv","tv8GIQDa","1AYfSJ9O","gZr7EykF","QRQLkNPJ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/25d48c335340c12566044c8f35df5102e72dc06c.png"},"version":{"id":"gZr7EykF","project_id":"w7ThoJFB","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"2.11.2","version_number":"2.11.2","changelog":"- Fix broken Controlify compatibility\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-30T17:55:28.954325Z","downloads":167912,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"75d8785b79cd2333f4d1d326da55ba5fc6372f8d","sha512":"93b15012dab0e43a0ae4c32dc130e12baa4467c4d0a01a130f2a0fd8f8bf7ac5dd8b31660f98fb8124830f6b1e0e6973296251d614e4a85dfff30a5af4267ace"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/versions/gZr7EykF/Zoomify-2.11.2.jar","filename":"Zoomify-2.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":999881,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"VAryyl46","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Zoomify-2.11.2.jar"},"mods\\BetterF3-7.0.1-Fabric-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"98911ba4f85da41e9d920274f0d165a951fcf3790c35a3bf007d90461ff07638b02c3f82219a4a75856fd435ef3aababf7db302a885f1d1f8461333d7c4c099c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8shC1gFX","slug":"betterf3","project_type":"mod","team":"uWJ0gwSz","title":"BetterF3","description":"BetterF3 is a mod that replaces Minecraft's original debug HUD with a highly customizable, more human-readable HUD.","body":"# BetterF3 \n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n\n#### BetterF3 is a mod that replaces Minecraft's original debug HUD with a highly customizable, more human-readable HUD.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious.

It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">slime chunks</strong>&nbsp;mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

you return to the Title Screen early while your world is still saving in the background!","body":"## FastQuit\n\n### About this mod\n\nThis mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.\n\nDon't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!\n\nThe world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.\nThis is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.\n\nIn its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.\nIf you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.\n\n**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**\n\n### Join the Discord!\n\nIf you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!\n\n### Configure\n\nTo configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.\n\nThere is currently three options to configure:\n\n**Show Toasts**:\n\nDetermines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.\n\n**Background Thread Priority**:\n\nSets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.\nThis is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.\nValue has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.\n\n**Render \"Saving world\" Screen**:\n\nWhen playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.\nBy enabling this setting the \"Saving world\" screen will be rendered.\n\n**Show Saving Time**\n\nDetermines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.\nValue has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

You will have to either delete or rename your old deaths.dat file in order for DeathLog to work again. \n\n***\nYou can access your log from the vanilla *Statistics* screen. This is a global list, but by default will be filtered to only include deaths from the world or server you're currently in.\n***\nThe search bar accounts for\n- Item Names\n- Coordinates\n- World or Server Names\n- Death Messages\n- ...\n\nYou can get your lost items back while in creative mode by simply clicking on them with your mouse wheel.

If you are a user, this means this mod does nothing on it's own and you should only install it when using another mod that depends on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Install the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mrcrayfish\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MrCrayfish</strong></span></a> if you want in-game configuration!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">This port became necessary as I wasn't able to find an existing config api on Fabric which suited my needs, also I have a bunch of code built on top of Forge's api, so just porting the api was the easiest solution. Any other dev seeking to use the Forge config api on Fabric to maintain their project(s) on both loaders is welcome to use this library. Instructions on how to add Forge Config API Port to your development workspace can be found on the GitHub page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you're using a multiloader Gradle setup for your workspace, e.g. as demonstrated <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>here</strong></span></a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredlll08\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jared</strong></span></a>, Forge Config API Port is especially useful, as it can be directly added to the common sub project, so that all Forge config features can be used in any sub project, mod loader specific code only being required once when registering configs. It's really neat, believe me!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code>, or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><del>Default in-game configuration will be added when the related <a href=\"https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/8874\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>PR</strong></span></a> is finalized and merged into Forge. Since the approach the Forge team is taking for configs screens is rather basic, I'm also planning on providing my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for Fabric, to offer in-game configuration in a more user-friendly and feature packed manner.</del></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">More information concerning the licensing of this project and additional information for other developers can be found on the GitHub repo.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆 Credits:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Developing Forge Config API Port was helped and inspired by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The whole Forge team, they really did a great job putting together this config api for Forge.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 36px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_/projects\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs_&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=curseforge&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Fuzss\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzss&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l26SuCmCNSCPefpfbCX7Q\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=youtube&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"89\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=@Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=twitter&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"124\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=u/Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=reddit&amp;logoColor=white\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"130\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs%200212&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"127\" height=\"28\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>","published":"2021-12-03T10:23:02.288424Z","updated":"2023-09-21T22:19:29.117770Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":487856,"followers":712,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["VpvE1h2H","16w4kT84","3h8hgyqP","AxEvkjh5","notOZAjX","GJ0aBxFN","2eL7Opm5","JpOqHq5p","jwtFMyhT","eYeUbc3T","86FCTo9M","rXgI0k5P","h7joEojU","WjwjuiDp","p2C10JUL","4JaArhTS","XGKEYlsw","K7z34XSj","vlllTHgw","akDg87hC","JdloDJit","KjE2hCJv","XhjJZ5uE","fI5AsaV4","CkM0mGHX","H1LkHOeQ","hRGdglV6","FtpEL8G9","tlNCwMwZ","sJryrwj9","tqRbIeBK","bh0uyJuX","alqrny5V","cjmImt9R","6J0K7FyD","3VCgXZ79","TFLCxTVc","mFoJ8qnh","ou26o2qg","MkqOn4Yc","2TybfFU8","oYUxEUGk","nlcnay8A","1cG1sI8e","ewYccCIi","CtENDTlF","f5d9VI72"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ohNO6lps/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"CtENDTlF","project_id":"ohNO6lps","author_id":"rHdGpxOA","featured":false,"name":"[FABRIC] [1.20.1] ForgeConfigAPIPort-v8.0.0","version_number":"v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v7.0.0-1.20] -

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support. For Fabric it depends on Cloth Config, for Forge it will use the default Forge config system in the backend.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

allowing you to quickly rotate, balance or clear the crafting grid.\n\nAdditionally, holding shift on the balance button you can also quickly spread a single stack over the entire grid, right-clicking the result slot will craft en entire stack, and there's a keybind for compressing stacks of items to its 3x3 or 2x2 recipe through a key press.\n\n## Features\n\n- Rotate the outer circle of the crafting grid\n- Balance the materials in the crafting grid to even stack sizes\n- Clear the crafting grid into your inventory\n- Transfer items into the grid by holding the W key while clicking them (Shift+W transfers all of type)\n- Instantly compress or decompress blocks into their block/ingot forms through a keybind\n- Right-click the result slot to craft a full stack\n- Supports many modded Crafting Tables\n- Bi-optional. Only those who want to use it need to install it, and if the server doesn't have it installed, it will still work for people who do have it installed.\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/32/561/ctspread.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" />\n    <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/32/562/ctclear.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/32/563/ctrotate.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" />\n    <img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/32/560/ctbalance.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" />\n</p>","published":"2022-06-14T18:16:29.313238Z","updated":"2023-09-27T07:01:35.378776Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":71105,"followers":144,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["dXRb2LFV","lcifm82J","XXSRJlH1","2lJnYaeR","M9rqyi5U","dIfJgrtZ","8YFo5WQL","TR0tkJWb","c0feVAUH","VUzil4JJ","BgwwMD48","HPAJLo7C","e8OrScgh","MMRBlTzv","c3oJXxtm","jm3MDxsl","lLXZEvzk","IYaR7bGK","yqM9N5Xg","8c8gPXdd","bGwiOXKq","2uAisxKA","IKXfKSzT","f0C0FKhV","h47liBvn","sLmX6cpz","dv6E7bUz","YPx9Kurp","291sIr19","PXPJ7RMy","R9P3qVZS","6eE3Eg93","VEjAkUh6","kcruX51n","MgKDQk6r","zVu4IRwj","CU6QPyel","OjUnElKd","7DBZfmKJ","GdcCBfsr","VAYXtmNg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DMu0oBKf/9f2a32d53d372659e464fd18be6d6c0ba2035b0d.png"},"version":{"id":"OjUnElKd","project_id":"DMu0oBKf","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"18.2.1+fabric-1.20","version_number":"18.2.1+fabric-1.20","changelog":"- **Hotfix:** Fixed key modifiers missing translations\n- Added support for Tom's Simple Storage\n- Added support for Extended Crafting\n- Added support for Simple Storage Network\n- Added buttonStyle property to API (Java, IMC, Data Pack), allowing mod compat to use smaller or narrower buttons\n- Changed buttonOffsetX and buttonOffsetY to now apply to alignToGrid also instead of being ignored when no button positions are set\n- Fixed alignToGrid not working correctly with bigger grids\n\n---\n\n- **Hotfix:** Fixed crash on dedicated server\n- Added support for data packs specifying crafting grids for compatibility https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/CraftingTweaks#data-packs\n- Added /craftingtweaks debug command which allows for click-dragging over a crafting grid to print the appropriate data pack JSON\n- Fixed recipe book button positioning when used with EMI","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-18T06:57:57.246845Z","downloads":43315,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"05739d3372b06e6869d5fe6b1ac8958475f6c98e7f2e1113d0b29b4bfa32e37e98fbd8b6f812ec9691c1114e42812d6f43987aeb34ae3cc5240b7fe9d66bcdc3","sha1":"e270aff2138bb3e86295651b5129f1e78c67f3c2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DMu0oBKf/versions/OjUnElKd/craftingtweaks-fabric-1.20-18.2.1.jar","filename":"craftingtweaks-fabric-1.20-18.2.1.jar","primary":true,"size":218780,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"t2PQujYy","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"craftingtweaks-fabric-1.20-18.2.1.jar"},"mods\\yosbr-0.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"254f2225f6446523aa8c8274e83b31e27f3b2afc8fe4f490fb1b169dd518e10c7993acda5db0ab597474ddf9d69506b5e794242fada1e2f89ed7bf9d412a8f78","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"WwbubTsV","slug":"yosbr","project_type":"mod","team":"GBU3scgV","title":"Your Options Shall Be Respected (YOSBR)","description":"Your options shall be respected.","body":"Your options shall be respected, brought to you by the \"Association for Options Rights\" gang.\n\nThis mod has one simple function, to provide default options if the corresponding option file doesn't exist.\n\n### Example 1 (options.txt)\n\nCreate /config/yosbr/options.txt\nPut default content in it\nLaunch game!

It seeks to give a more realistic feel to parts of the game that can benefit from it, like simulating physics and making model parts move that normally don't.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Ghast Tentacles</strong> divides ghast tentacles into parts and makes them wiggle realistically, like those tentacle monsters you always see at the movies. Makes them a little more scary, but ultimately nicer to look at.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Squiggly Squid Tentacles</strong> gives a jellyfish-like effect to the swimming animation of squids. Also makes their tentacles flow more while moving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Playful Doggy</strong> changes wolf tails to be fluffier and flowier, wagging realistically while they stand and run. Also makes tamed wolves lie down instead of sitting. Hold up some meat and they'll roll over, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Flowy Ocelot Tail</strong> takes away the stick tails of the current ocelots and gives them something nicer instead. Fully animated flowing tails that move while they stand or run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Curly Cat Tail</strong> brings those beautiful animated flowing tails ocelots are so proud to have to cats as well. And that's not all; they even curl around their bodies when they sit!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Oinky Pig</strong> adds a very subtle animation, makes a pig's snout move when it oinks. It only moves up and down ever so slightly, but it's there. Just a little bit more life for your livestock. And don't you forget about the floaty ears! Pretty big for such a small animal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Cow Udder</strong> makes the udders on cows wobble around when they walk. Also makes their udders have nipples, but if you're sensitive to that kind of thing those can be deactivated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bucka Bucka Chicken</strong> makes chicken's bills open and close when they cluck. The bill is also a lot more slim, so no more confusing chickens with ducks! And when they strut their heads move back and forth, the wattles under the bill swing around and their wings flap a little. Just like the real deal!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Villager Nose</strong> does a subtle change, this makes villagers wiggle their big noses whenever they make their unique \"hmmm\" sound! It's a small change, but who doesn't get a kick out of it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Iron Golem Nose</strong> is exactly the same as above, except for iron golems! Since they don't make any noise the nose wiggles around when they're hurt instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jiggly Liquidy Slime</strong> brings a pleasing visual change: This makes the insides of slimes flow around like liquid. They splish-splosh about even more when they jump. The eyes, the mouth, and the core itself all move independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Magma Cube Burger</strong> adds a custom death animation to magma cubes, which causes their bodies to form into a pile of steamy, delicious hamburger patties when they die. Unfortunately, you can't eat them because they're way too hot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spider Knees</strong> are a truly stunning visual addition. Spiders now finally have the knees they've always dreamed of. Also affects cave spiders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Creeper</strong> wakes some memories of that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2rDbRUDkds\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">very popular music video</span></a> from way back in the day by the one and only <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">CaptainSparklez</span></a>. Remember the really cute wobbly Creeper? Well, it's in the game now. The full thing, the real deal, exactly like the video. Probably the best custom animation in the entire collection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Arm Flailing Enderman</strong> makes an angry enderman wave its arms around wildly while chasing its target. Suits their twisted nature very well: wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube endermen!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Animated Snow Man Stick</strong> makes a snowman's arm swing when it throws a snowball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Kneeling Sheep</strong> is pretty kneat. It makes sheep actually bend down to eat grass. It's no longer just their head lowering, their whole body lowers down to get a sweet sample of that succulent cellulose. Did you notice their KNEES bend, too when they kneel?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Familiar Horse</strong> makes horses more lively again, just like they used to be in older versions. Does this by adding back their mouth and knees while staying true to the vanilla model style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spitful Llama</strong> makes llamas open their mouth when spitting. How have they been doing that before?!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bending Humanoid Knees</strong> makes the knees of zombie-like as well as piglin-like mobs bend when they walk around. Looks pretty fluid and nice. You'll like it, trust me.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷

Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-06-26T05:15:03.318589Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":686630,"followers":2325,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":268931,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5","sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar"},"mods\\CITResewn-1.1.3+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"9cd0d8445e65e530cbe1df26809cdf56b84502146f0dd601c47a7ba5df8dd8b861d1cc0344e06cd5277dac71c448376f01ea12be953644ebcba76a8b63befed5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"otVJckYQ","slug":"cit-resewn","project_type":"mod","team":"Je2HSsoZ","title":"CIT Resewn","description":"Re-implements MCPatcher's CIT (custom item textures from optifine resource packs)","body":"<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/logo_shadow.png\" alt=\"CIT Resewn\" width=\"247\" height=\"247\"></center>\n<center>CIT Resewn is MCPatcher's CIT features re-written outside of optifine as a standalone mod for fabric</center>\n\n[<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/docs.png\" alt=\"Go to the docs for more info!\" width=\"268\" height=\"53\"></center>](https://citresewn.shcm.io/)\n\n[<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/link_curse.png\" alt=\"Curseforge\" width=\"135\" height=\"53\"></center>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn)\n\n### Huh? What does it do?\nMCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.\n\nCustom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.\n\nCIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!\n\nOn top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.\n\n### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?\nCIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.\n\nFirst, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called \"magic numbers\" instead of the new text ids will not work.\n\nSecond, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or \"broken\") paths.<br>\nThese are paths that contain \"Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes\" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)\n\nLastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:\n`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`\n\n### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?\nWhile CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.\n\nWith all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.\n\nThere were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.<br>\nMy official statement on compatibility with these mods is \"if it works it works\" unless I say otherwise.\n\n### What about Forge?\nForge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.\n\nDo not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.\n\n### 1.16/other versions?\nSee [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)\n\n<strike>If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.</strike><br>\nWell not anymore!

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-09-23T21:11:09.410835Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2736950,"followers":6745,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":794922,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d","sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1363084?v=4","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods\\autoswitch-7.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"8cfe3b583caf486e9c5f633015eaa709e0089a5eac79d8a03b0c8379b8ae5d655a4686c2fd94b9633e4b5c0a6ae7dc0e932676a7ac3d84f89f6847f354a80616","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uSdcnlts","slug":"autoswitch","project_type":"mod","team":"duYggubQ","title":"AutoSwitch","description":"Automatic switching of tools when you perform an action.","body":"![client](https://img.shields.io/badge/Environment-Client-1976d2?style=for-the-badge)\n[![Fabric API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-Fabric%20API-purple?style=for-the-badge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api \"Download Fabric API\")\n\n# What Autoswitch Does\nAutoswitch (AS) reads the player's hotbar, and finds the best tool for the job currently available based on the config files (ie. you hit a stone block with your fist, it will switch to a pickaxe).\nThese tools have some conditions that need to be satisfied:\n* Have more than 3 durability remaining _configurable_\n* Have the tool on your hotbar\n* Be capable of mining the block (a naive fallback is in place for mining levels _configurable_)\n* It is aware of tool enchantments\n\nAutoSwitch is fully configurable. The config files detail their specifics at their top, and each option is documented within the file. A hotkey is available to quickly toggle switching on or off, along with a toggle command.\n\n## Blocks\nAS checks the block's Material*, or the specific block's id if it is present in the config file, and will evaluate the tools based on the configuration.\n\n### *Note\nSee the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Materials#Materials) for details. The names used in the config files are the same as the names Fabric uses, which differ from the names on the wiki. Each material is documented within the config file.\n\n## Entities\nAS checks the entities group*, or the specific id if it is present in the config file, and will evaluate the tools based on the configuration. Bases weapon choices in part on the amount of damage the tool can do.\n\n### *Note\nSee [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob#Weaknesses_and_immunities) for details on entity groups.\nGroup names are not exactly the same between the wiki and what Fabric uses.\n\n## Other\nIf a mod's tools do not work automatically, tell the mod author of that mod to add their tools to the proper FabricToolTags. Some mods may require other changes to function. Autoswitch provides an API by which mod authors can create their own tool groups similar to the provided pickaxe, axe, etc.","published":"2020-12-14T15:21:01.262761Z","updated":"2023-09-16T22:04:09.639222Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":13341,"followers":174,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.3","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.5","1.16.5-rc1","1.16-pre1","1.16-pre2","1.16-pre3","1.16-pre4","1.16-pre5","1.16-pre6","1.16-pre7","1.16-pre8","1.16-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17-pre1","1.17-pre2","1.17-pre3","1.17-pre4","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17-rc2","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.2","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-pre6","1.18-pre7","1.18-pre8","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18-rc4","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.1-pre1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1-pre3","1.19.1-pre4","1.19.1-pre5","1.19.1-pre6","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-rc2","1.19.1-rc3","1.19.2","1.19.2-rc1","1.19.2-rc2","1.19.3","1.19.4-pre1","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.2","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","20w14a","20w15a","20w16a","20w17a","20w18a","20w19a","20w20a","20w20b","20w21a","20w22a","20w27a","20w28a","20w29a","20w30a","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","21w03a","21w05a","21w05b","21w06a","21w07a","21w08a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","21w15a","21w16a","21w17a","21w18a","21w19a","21w20a","21w37a","21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","21w41a","21w42a","21w43a","21w44a","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","22w16a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","22w24a","22w42a","22w43a","22w44a","22w45a","23w03a","23w04a","23w05a","23w06a","23w07a","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["T2lW6Rtc","JgYXgIMG","GvI2xCyM","86fWhvCd","KoqQJZEu","AXU0aWnI","LQNXLCjZ","zY2Mrd61","E19FNVEM","X71gU3tE","LszhAVnJ","gzFvrbw8","VQT2JiWy","6bWspzpo","FBegkeSY","jZfp6p41","1tB4AxE0","JD7u7JwM","Wk6K4KjD","rAQjipwt","EQ6x3m1P","xF9veOWq","zKZn8Xlu","CKPCA7BG","k7KgjWcr","3gBl0xRp","GCsOY4tY","sNJFuYoq","G6Q2xkfr","aabKPEdw","vJ8ltk8Y","dbPSoAgs","dWNF1iF7","K1wYAxIP","1hd4CMo4","Q1zrbEV3","uv9b9Vsu","BLkDKkuO","I0yxC8g9","C2E8SXmZ","n9s2XVpq","6OvGUdhd","kKGVeyg0","nY6reJtC","QW33lhHq","6DB8LAZ4","cjAk9E08","hQsWCGWl","QzPNlRIC","2P4NNCsi","v6VxwlQk","YyKpCtB7","FrQK0LUo","1VTM6cH5","RPZDbi9X","z3bZL9Ah","iRWO1q1m","PBTyyaM0","eeOinryK","YuwmSTjX","35svdKrH","6Jieo6Oo","KlT8Ygh4","WwtTMaXZ","RQGXH7GG","NwUpHj5t","uH60sIyo","km8hiOB9","Pk7fVOi1","H8ASKnWr","HlAYmXG9","J4tWnLnz","wmwoHgQj","EUn8SeoP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uSdcnlts/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"J4tWnLnz","project_id":"uSdcnlts","author_id":"AcyNIavh","featured":false,"name":"AutoSwitch 7.0.2 (autopublished)","version_number":"7.0.2","changelog":"This is autopublished from Github Actions.

height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2.8.0/assets/cozy/social/discord-singular_vector.svg\">](https://discord.gg/etTDQAVSgt)\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/icon.png\" align=\"right\" width=\"128px\"/>\n\nThis client side mod allows you to paste special characters into the chat, on signs, books, and in the anvil text box.\nIt also has support for a customizable symbol and kaomoji list.\nAdditionally, you can select a unicode font that is supported by minecraft,\nand your typed text will automatically get converted into the supported characters.\nAll symbols are unifont symbols supported by minecraft, meaning all other players can see them without needing the mod on their client or the server.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe symbol panel can be accessed by clicking the small button on the bottom left, available in several screens:\n\n* Chat screen\n* Anvil screen\n* Sign edit screen\n* Book editing screen\n\n![Symbol menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/symbol_menu.png)\n\nWhen opened, on the top there are multiple tabs in which all symbols are grouped.\nClicking on a symbol in a tab will paste it into your chat box.\nThe first tab shows all available symbols of the following tabs and additionally has a search bar for finding a specific symbol.\n\n![All symbols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/symbol_list.gif)\n\nThe next tabs group the symbols into various categories:\n\n* Faces & People\n* Nature & Food\n* Things\n* Activities, Transport & Places\n* Symbols\n* Shapes\n\nThe tab labeled `K` contains various kaomojis like `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`.\n\nThe last tab is a favorites tab, which you can add favorite symbols too as well as adding custom symbols.\nTo favorite a symbol, just right click it in the symbol panel.\nSymbols can be un-favorited by just right-clicking it again.\n\n## Symbol suggestions\n\nFor inserting symbols faster, you can use the symbol suggestion popup, which works similar to other chat platforms.\nBy typing a colon (`:`), a popup will open and shows symbols that match with what you type after.\nFor example, if you type `:cro` it will suggest a crown, crocodile, croissant, cross and crossed flags.\n\n![Symbol menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/suggestion.png)\n\nIf you just enter a colon without entering anything after, it will show the first couple favorited symbols for quick access.\n\n\n## Fonts\n\nOn the top right of supported screens, you can choose between many different fonts.\nYou can select a font on the dropdown on the top right.\nThis will change the text you type to that font.\nFonts make use of unicode characters to produce a more interesting looking text.\nThese are also supported on clients without symbol-chat and can be seen by everyone.\n\n![Fonts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/fonts.png)\n\n## Config\n\nSome aspects of this mod are configurable using [Cloth config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) (not required).\nThe configuration screen is accessible through the gear button on the top of the chat screen, as well as the [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) config button.\n\nThe config allows you to change the appearance and behavior of the symbol-chat HUD.\nYou can also add custom symbols not present in the tabs by adding them to the \"Favorite symbols\" text box.\nThere is also support for adding custom kaomojis.\n\n![Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/config.png)\n\n## Unicode table\n\nAs an advanced feature, you can access a unicode table through the `⣿⣿` button next to the config buton.\nThis allows you to browse all unicode pages with the minecraft font to find new symbols.\nYou can also search symbols and directly add them to your favorites or copy them to the clipboard.\n\n![Unicode

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods (ImmersivePortals benefits a lot from this)\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2023-10-02T18:16:52.181784Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1273824,"followers":3200,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Z9FJWLMt","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T18:16:30.272151Z","downloads":127781,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b662fd625ba1f06c6e4958eac373856047d0d2a9","sha512":"2a42ef76cd2a60af01fffed1cd9e08270b537f116f7fa0ede49a5b526fa7b9860845a6f321c4a7600f80e739391eb24a6e6d9850c33894b58bc2d01a8a63f8b4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Z9FJWLMt/continuity-3.0.0-beta.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1050571,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"peppercode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44146161?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\linkart-5.3.0-1.20.2.jar":{"sha512":"81f7da7ffc3ed14a7a4d5d52adab85a5eef869f455127d19eb0e4b17626564c9663db93516cf055962ca4386c75b735d28f11330d932e112e0b90f67e08d5eed","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"sc4Mu9Zu","slug":"linkart","project_type":"mod","team":"mYArNTiE","title":"Linkart","description":"Linkart allows you to link your carts together via chains","body":"\n![Linkart banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104443436/235352554-84561cd0-9313-4107-a349-7c8c831ecb90.png)\n\n\n[![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/title/622736.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/linkart-updated)\n[![Connector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sinytra/.github/main/badges/connector/compacter.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector)\n\n\n## The Problem:\nMinecarts are useless because they are slow and can't be linked together!\n\n## The Solution:\nLinkart!

This makes it much easier to find what you have done and what you still need to do.\n\nFor example, the \"Discover every Biome\" Advancement doesn't tell you what's still missing; this mod will help you go for that last biome you haven't visited.\n\nThis works with data pack Advancements as well; here's an example from BlazeAndCave:\n\n![Screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/images/18e15e0dd7ffa0a9e1eb5eaa85bf0fa1dabf0777.png \"Screenshot\")\n\nIf the list to the right overflows, you can use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvancements, and their objectives, have their very own names, which may or may not correspond to MineCraft items, blocks, or entities. The mod tries its best to map those names to Minecraft objects, but in some cases, especially with Data Packs, that's just not possible. The mod will show the internal name in that case in the hope you're better at deciphering what's needed than the mod itself. \n\nFor example, the objective of \"The Parrots and the Bats\" is named \"bred\", this will show as bred in the info box. \n\n\nThis is the very first version of the mod, and as such, there are probably still bugs. Please report them!\n\nTo make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft, \nit has been optimized using\n [![JProfiler Logo](https://www.ej-technologies.com/images/product_banners/jprofiler_small.png \"Logo\")](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html).","published":"2020-12-10T07:16:17.383874Z","updated":"2023-06-28T12:19:36.792674Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":635204,"followers":961,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre5","1.18","1.18.2","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","20w46a","20w49a","20w51a","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","21w37a","21w39a","21w40a","22w45a"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7CcuXvo8","WdvJfoeZ","cG7TokqN","M4TW1uhs","HILGlO18","tAekKEwa","kK2M3xop","6Em9IM5o","KIh7C2jj","UjVVEDzy","46lPmfqC","J2iSDOlC","ehJF8nc8","GMo7T4Xo","KPQY6mZp","irVcytpD","SjmQw2Uq","ktAuncew","X9P1aArG","B7tL3HcK","sVKaNGOr","9kObxiCk","CeaKOPoo","82WU0RPm","VfkzAPDA","Byz7gNoU","LCurb3dX","ULrQ3wMt","VJQWYcDz","u96MLURP","p4psnBkA","FwuDY3z5","HkMtkEM2","FURXdWNB","KeVl7NVo","gfcbMV82"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"gfcbMV82","project_id":"G1epq3jN","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"advancementinfo","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-28T12:19:38.294528Z","downloads":193663,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"dfa603a2db09d6e303dd2991f016550ae156e3d1","sha512":"ff10a77f831354f757c1ba4b6906e612549f3ac0dd3b15101dae29a459937bfceabe5e7ce7cd9126e58833a69e5a4ba04993dfcf2098830b9ccf2c192dddc0e5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/G1epq3jN/versions/gfcbMV82/advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar","filename":"advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":43895,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"KfkhaGhb","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"advancementinfo-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.4.jar"},"mods\\BetterPingDisplay-Fabric-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"5651a271904dc73f868a8cf307a6a517fc29631472af1258b5da90183afbf770205eb3a6404fa65c599d4fd3c04710ab47fe8339799cce7fc648f4929648c120","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MS1ZMyR7","slug":"better-ping-display-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"R0PUyVi8","title":"Better Ping Display [Fabric]","description":"Adds a configurable numerical ping display to the player list","body":"# Better Ping Display - Fabric Edition\n\nA [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod for Minecraft to display each player's ping in the player list as a number.\n\nGo [**here**](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-ping-display) for the Minecraft Forge edition of this mod.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HTrH0i2.png)\n\nThis is a client-side mod.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2023-09-23T14:02:42.436211Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1454018,"followers":4084,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Lue6O9z9","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.27 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.3/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.27+mc1.20.1","changelog":"- Bump version (comp500)\n- Support new Fabric API changes and Sodium 0.5.3 (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.27+mc1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T14:02:51.056536Z","downloads":223994,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c6e6627b8bb6a40497f27f86619ee5f17f68386f10585b4944e1aad01337a8f55be7401bc1824c69f94d755db3faaf16537b1d2d2cd282d24393d61df9b6fbef","sha1":"8c8e6b96243155b41f2f9d29d5940ee895bcb141"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Lue6O9z9/indium-1.0.27%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":104807,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4OZL6q9h","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.27+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\lighty-fabric-2.1.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"cbe29e6a9fbf022633a4eb9374a058b28aaddb4b1b9c49aa0a06ca7c0b4243010d1f69d91149bec6160ce2e22261665f7d3f744cdf7272379b13316327eddfb6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yjvKidNM","slug":"lighty","project_type":"mod","team":"atDgTyWl","title":"Lighty","description":"The Light Overlay Mod with a twist!","body":"Instead of rendering crosses or numbers on the top face of blocks, Lighty takes a different approach - It renders a transparent carpet-like block on top!

adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"143\" height=\"50\">\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons adds **four seasons** to Minecraft, each lasting 28 in-game days (configurable). The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2021-05-09T15:41:27.109292Z","updated":"2023-08-12T09:38:01.813799Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":179271,"followers":550,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-pre1","1.17-rc1","1.18.2","1.18-rc4","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["LhCaMIzy","jQoWa0il","zQt9Dd2v","McebIuW7","gtoXC9cr","t3cqWJpS","ZSlExvBh","nBxZtduO","k55LHPVG","hNV4laag","UBlv1O6X","JoW6p4c5","tXjlq5P9","SgKuDqln","UYBTrmgB","tjP6OtOn","FWErjNOd","Gil5sfVD","G7yrUl8Y","866aPKAj","k9JfRwVM","3wVgEG0u","7EU0UwXc","rLlocL2I","5yFOnFEL","QlPte8FN","dJtxMqxE","5TNKN9aR","sX1BCX14","hp6m6aJl","uMEzKato"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/7ce47fcb4242493ad069789298400b14f27737ad.png"},"version":{"id":"uMEzKato","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons 2.3","version_number":"2.3+1.20","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-12T09:38:04.242253Z","downloads":23114,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6ec4ca16e70fa95adb516ed984f1da4c009710ee43941b36cb9f441b42d6772de7f9a9c74909d10657b51d8b2a4d158917b7112a2094729949cccf7b8f169e21","sha1":"ad7a86f9bf9d2fed80b186422ab5e73bf235f4f8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/versions/uMEzKato/fabric-seasons-2.3%2B1.20.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":428398,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qABOlhS9","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar"},"mods\\XaerosWorldMap_1.36.0_Fabric_1.20.jar":{"sha512":"43a1f680a3a72e562cadfee5c01905e892968598d0dced0afa26c0bc9fbf524a40fcec04d853c6879f5c798bc7a6ac2666c7c52adb982ae3eb76570c67e4f905","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NcUtCpym","slug":"xaeros-world-map","project_type":"mod","team":"QWyiT27S","title":"Xaero's World Map","description":"Adds a full screen world map which shows you what you have explored in the world.

The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page.

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2023-10-03T09:07:54.950827Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":442209,"followers":1140,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/5e127e83e3b55e3cebf32e3e8b355296ea62d87d.png"},"version":{"id":"zO7oFMiv","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 1.0.2","version_number":"1.0.2","changelog":"- fixed a mistake in the block entity code causing unnecessary lag","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-20T06:34:34.178007Z","downloads":55646,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ad69d9bbe51135792a0eb6dd20bdc3736f6f64e82e7fed9fda16bd462734c55b1c8924284727fca61f5b7bf12da8a5f40fc2b4d5566222e1e2942b7a044f0976","sha1":"87147ac0b539ccb0f409a1eaa4914846b513db67"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/zO7oFMiv/entity_model_features_fabric_1.20-1.0.2.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20-1.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":290514,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BVzZfTc1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXLgMy6f","user":{"id":"rLbuLV6t","username":"Traben","name":"Traben","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8456487?v=4","bio":"What even is OptiFine?","created":"2022-01-26T01:51:52.290422Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20-1.0.2.jar"},"mods\\easiervillagertrading-1.20-fabric0.83.0-1.5.4.jar":{"sha512":"b82f2b342ff5273b2356c3415ce983b138cb54167bdc66f9b6668d973281049982f7686483296f277823a10e6059689b502ec810872377e06c5b96d8c5182b56","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ChscgScW","slug":"easiervillagertrading","project_type":"mod","team":"RFhnT9mt","title":"EasierVillagerTrading","description":"Fewer clicks to trade with villagers","body":"Mod description\n===============\n\nThis mod speeds up trading with villagers a lot, by changing the meaning of the buttons in the trade selection GUI:\n\n- Clicking a trade will execute this trade once (instead of just preparing it)\n- Shift-clicking a trade will execute it as often as possible (until either the villager locks the trade or you run out of trading materials)\n- Ctrl-clicking the trade will prepare, but not execute it (the default behaviour of the selection buttons)\n\nOlder versions of the mod (before MC 1.14) brought their own GUI, as those versions didn't have a quick way to select a trade.

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n##\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n<br>\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n##\n\n### Placeholders\n<br>\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n##\n\n### Config\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n\n```toml\n# Lets you enable /

(this is configurable)\n* Right-click trades or recipes to directly apply the crafting. When holding shift it will craft/trade a full stack\n* Also: Armor switch if MW is installed on the server-side 🙂\n\n## Configuration\nLots of stuff is configurable. To open the config screen you'll need to install [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu).\n\n## Limitations\nSince this mod is completely clientside item scrolling might be a bit laggy on hard-working servers.\n\n\nThis mod will not work in *Applied Energistics 2* screens and inventories. AE2 handles inventory screens even more strangely than Mojang handles creative inventories, so don't expect any fixes from my side!\n\nTo make you aware of this MW declares a conflict with AE2 which will show up in the log. This incompatibility only applies to certain mods and all other inventories will work fine.\n\n## Before Version 1.3.4\nThere are bugs in Tweed (library used by Mouse Wheelie) and Artifice (library of Extra Pieces) which make these mods incompatible when bundled within other mods.\n\nTo make Mouse Wheelie work with Extra Pieces please install the latest version of Tweed alongside!\n\nWith version 1.3.4 this bug has been fixed in Tweed and my other library mods - so no more incompatibilities from my side. Currently this bug still persists in Artifice so other mods might still be incompatible with Extra Pieces and all derivatives of Artifice.\n","published":"2020-12-22T00:25:18.334979Z","updated":"2023-10-07T08:26:30.523189Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":151168,"followers":913,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.16.5-rc1","1.17.1","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17-pre1","1.17-pre2","1.17-pre3","1.17-pre4","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","21w13a","21w14a","21w15a","21w16a","21w17a","21w18a","21w19a","22w06a","22w16a","22w17a"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["h719hnXo","24XWVv4H","mJVsiau8","yDQNiG1v","8sEmZ1nD","rnZXbVTB","ByYgvJhU","TZ0z6i7D","Ag98NrKK","PggOD3er","Rd0u7syf","6wJJQ33X","Amzyl6VC","HLoh2XXB","E8qJEpfg","7ddYbYW3","iQxwgiAF","TDmKKgak","fzNZlwOq","qcqrslIb","lKmF2uif","cee0obg3","4wlSrHMh","XIM4RiiZ","SycN5fV0","bjmjyen4","2u7IS1Lw","7FltZwOv","8xFCTh5W","zftsBLjV","hQm4udmf","CoYvVu0u","gL7KvZHU","mlAMqe16","RlzDkw4F","DoQwGDO3","rpbGK5iK","iTzFhLN4","pQNfi4Bx","ZQug1Aeg","itUXGzbC","Lf04bCin","SixCZfVc","cCV9Xcrd","IzMqpyhD","WMg1QsIk","FzmzRaLi","fzZPBH5c","5CUmFU4E","3ngJL09J","b9WaTx7Z","Huy754AQ","FktpYSQi","3ytj4zL0","lwpAqVaH","yvwXSQdv","Rr1DcHMq","3J1aNVLJ","23Nw5zzU","iiu83Y3c","UeiAKbpX","gFA95EIa","zY7Cf3LW","cM3ObaFu","fHlm0rzK","agVRPZ4D","MPCf9ut6","PEKBd3El","PkISnwUh","GfgvMtyQ","xwp8g9CO","FOq96T8x","xTx0O62x","lXkJSYAH","yQusLI7s","fNtdHcP5","6Y1z49b4","khSmZgLT","TEtrxmrp","wUp62kni","wBqPB5xY","tXfvYvI1","2ebv7N77","VinQJO3v","ymIYCJPX","b1B6X2Ts","NTpvjLr2","a4SvIbAl","Soe84zhH","dryZj18F","DQZQWgOz","nJNMgakE","nmB6cDYk","7hY6TItH","KY8qViXG","P6lILGgm","chRnLbfn","GdHlLNRp","va0UPMPO","jHVCUNXq","J0haBi6t","Zl5ysFVm","mnbVSXOO","5HmD82tm","idJfKEnz","bCGRhsZx","KMjUmnju","Ja2BYc1Y","o6RxDq9H","oaIp47rP","OhnrKojw","fLRP12Mt","iIdZaHt3","ZvHQfeTB","xQflaC4T","gjck3ULm","SqayzTTv","HO17Gk1z","rIYypwDC","lcCY0KZL","rvkjp7nF","93JSZCN4","dgBoPrse","4iex10ex","5aMlBb4H","e0rd3G30","3K7SCKOR","Mm0H8wn7","BEsP37OJ","8n4MvQ1n","CkjvPWpv","sgkCkgSO","Gud3HLU2","VoRXECAU","lgzMuZBH","FbQkpg7G","EPlvximc","6uHsa6Rn","f24IuTiJ","q2BSIY4P","8oect3E2","HDUIbH1G","ayAWRAes","JGZJ4UqD","tBQLIhI1","PQGEoKza","1xCyaLWg","MC48NEHw","5mYFyLcg","2VMUOKtw","vv9WzK01","ugx6shZH","R0tsn51l","uaxAu6IZ","4hjGaj6D","c6Ht2mCa","yb0UJjSM","MpGOHks3","Y0sGEyyU","fWlmQNBf","3ni9nRcB","WzN3aIKG","vpoRSwN4","GlENOQej","5q5ojaBJ","WOL5XBup","bTHE5J3n","o7VxXDbj","UygfI1MO","HPzsUVnT","faPpjxKD","uQqxNGqs","hUZXtd1H","pgVpuqvW","C3dGBp1r","vymcxgLT","T7Ogh3Ft","Nbpfn58U","EJvmB978","jyqMTpO1","jNgyObL0","wZQXaled","iTSdJaug","371iEBPS","tTMaU713","r1RocWRi","8RLuRzch","QmT8RpnQ","eN3F8JKA","Xyl3zo4h","ZipUueYk","QXkLg21K","cu12faXh","m0dAzH9I","LeOE3qju","I5ILhd6J","auT5QGkW","f0VEYjAS","KdK5dXWp","Ow7EojXn","ZfHqIlXv","e8Y4GnH0","SSkZxx08","H7OsQ8Jt","iF7T9odz","5TxOjQHP","uMGgnGSW","4aQoMc29","tcruvzMQ","XvWmUhot","Vd71xYQG","aRVszPQB","aONy2c3p","TCt49JkS","BUydj5yt","KNLEqpmH","yTSkWqiJ","QNBiceN7","1uDKNRQF","ZDH1ONdq","IjbA4WTe","kgCmdbQm","xWpY6VCr","eGC7FVo7","5R7l84zv","kvQiy5Oa","W6lK0S30","wPtDzPBH","jE5B3lub","Hg3JOa79","EzeYeJRf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/u5Ic2U1u/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"wPtDzPBH","project_id":"u5Ic2U1u","author_id":"JJJqUOvE","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1]

to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights?style=flat-square)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/LICENSE)\n![Environment: Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-client-1976d2?style=flat-square)\n[![Mod loader: Fabric]][fabric] \n\nA dynamic lights mod for Quilt and Fabric.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nIt's dark outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

(Fabric)","description":"Rewrites the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors","body":"Starlight\n==================\nFabric mod for rewriting the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors.\n\nMinecraft 1.20 Light engine changes\n------------------\nPlease see: https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/6cc1acdd03a9b7ac34699bf5e8f1b85c\nTL;DR\nMojang improved upon their own light engine using the same performance critical designs from Starlight. As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

is a performance profiler for Minecraft clients, servers and proxies.","body":"![spark](https://i.imgur.com/ykHn9vx.png)\n\n#### spark is a performance profiler for Minecraft clients, servers and proxies.\n\n#### Useful Links\n* [**Website**](https://spark.lucko.me/) - browse the project homepage\n* [**Documentation**](https://spark.lucko.me/docs) - read documentation and usage guides\n* [**Downloads**](https://spark.lucko.me/download) - latest plugin/mod downloads\n\n## What does spark do?\n\nspark is made up of three separate components:\n\n* **CPU Profiler**: Diagnose performance issues.\n* **Memory Inspection**: Diagnose memory issues.\n* **Server Health Reporting**: Keep track of overall server health.\n\n### ⚡ CPU Profiler\n\nspark's profiler can be used to diagnose performance issues: \"lag\", low tick rate, high CPU usage, etc.\n\nIt is:\n\n* **Lightweight** - can be ran in production with minimal impact.\n* **Easy to use** - no configuration or setup necessary, just install the plugin.\n* **Quick to produce results** - running for just ~30 seconds is enough to produce useful insights into problematic areas for performance.\n* **Customisable** - can be tuned to target specific threads, sample at a specific interval, record only \"laggy\" periods, etc\n* **Highly readable** - simple tree structure lends itself to easy analysis and interpretation. The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-09-22T20:36:10.170755Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":250062,"followers":620,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"XGW2fviP","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.53 (Fabric 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-fabric","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

Now rewritten from scratch in Kotlin for cleaner code, better performance, more features, and extensibility.\nOther mods' developers can add their custom containers and customization options. See documentation link above.\n\n[Supports most OptiFine GUI resource packs](#supported-resource-packs). If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue (select the **Report a bug** template).\n\nCheck out my new OptiGUI resource pack for Minecraft 1.19+: [Chest Boat GUI](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/chest-boat-gui)\n\n> Because Fabric/Loom/Gradle/Java broke the pre-refactor codebase, Minecraft 1.20.2 will not get a stable 2.1.5-based release, only 2.2.0 alphas. I decided not to suffer. I have more important IRL stuff, and some burnout.\n>\n> The stable OptiGUI 2.2.0 is planned to be released in 2024. Please be patient or use the alpha releases.\n\n[![BisectHosting banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/a661d818-b1af-427c-9754-12e8b243fd60.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/opekope2)\n\n## How to use it\n\n1. Download and install [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) or [Quilt loader](https://quiltmc.org/en/install)\n2. Download this mod from your [favorite service](#optigui)\n3. Download the required dependencies as well\n4. Put this mod in your mods folder\n\n## Resource pack docs\n\nThis mod supports a superset of OptiFine features, see documentation link above. Some of them are not supported by OptiFine, and are marked as such.\n\n## Supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [Colourful Containers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-gui/)\n* [Colourful Containers Add-On](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/updated-colourful-containers-light-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Colourful Containers Dark Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-dark-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Animated RGB GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/optifine-animated-rgb-gui) ¹\n* [NEON20 ANIMATED](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/neon20-animated-optifine/)\n* [Rybo's Enhanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/rybo-s-enhanced-gui/)\n* [Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/animated-fox-guis-1-16-x/) ¹\n* [\\[DARK\\] Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fox-4931933/) ¹\n\n¹ see FAQ for animation support\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. If you know a resource pack which works, and you'd like to see it here, or a resource pack, which does not work, but works with OptiFine, please open an issue.\n\n## Partially supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) ¹\n\n¹ Barrel does not work, neither does it work with OptiFine. The resource pack does not specify it according to the format.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Use in a modpack?\n\nYes.\n\n### OptiFine GUI animations?\n\nOnly with [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica).\n\n### OptiFine colors (colors.properties)?\n\nNo, use [Colormatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/colormatic).\n\n### Configuration GUI/file?\n\nNothing to configure.\n\n### Sodium?\n\nYes.\n\n### OptiFine?\n\nActually, OptiGUI and OptiFine (with OptiFabric) **can** be loaded simultaneously.\nI have observed that OptiGUI mixins will be placed before OptiFine ones, so you can turn off custom GUIs in OptiFine to save performance.\n\nHowever, I can't assist you with this.\n\n### Supported loaders?\n\nFabric & Quilt. Anything else is not supported, those may or may not work.\n","published":"2022-05-02T09:52:47.910376Z","updated":"2023-09-10T20:22:19.317720Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":450750,"followers":441,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["LICx0kWh","W7KZowlh","GlXDrxTY","jvJfecx9","2zE7dj3R","bds6PhCr","LjxrGjwN","KWUgM1Pm","EmeZ0Gqt","SBi7COdt","enCs35o3","QNaBS24G","o5KsFiVJ","WwSxteqI","w1ctchwV","DvWsedjb","IDfdFriT","KaUaJJ1i","jdW6CBhM","RMa6KMf9","HpDkLZjj","bqQWHwWx","ehlFpVEb","3uGk4ChO","eM7FKWWG","L99Bxt2Y","2oUHeIhM","v4BLjO6F","vJb4cpaY","TM9YqUwX","EOU9oC3S","LVdJJtmU","XflepaVP","P6myMR8K","xQrH4kWR","YU9Yi2mO","41AoOR3G","3CSEKfcd","x0k8u61W","noPVqZnY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/2ec739011e612256ebe0c79a4ce064d0e453dd0f.png"},"version":{"id":"noPVqZnY","project_id":"JuksLGBQ","author_id":"PpKojnYx","featured":false,"name":"OptiGUI 2.2.0-alpha.1","version_number":"2.2.0-alpha.1","changelog":"# OptiGUI 2.2.0-alpha.1 developer preview\n\n## What's new since 2.1.5\n\n* Refactor codebase\n* Extend API for 3rd party mods\n  * Split API JAR from main JAR\n* Huge performance improvements\n  * Significantly reduce allocations while evaluating filters\n  * Significantly reduce allocations while a supported GUI screen is open\n* Inspector for resource pack creators (default keybind is `F12`)\n* Add new selectors (will update the documentation)\n* Fix trader llama bug\n\n## About this release\n\n* Extract and repurpose bundled OptiGlue to LiLaC (new dependency)\n* This is the first developer preview of 2.2.0\n* For other mod developers: the API will likely change in the alpha phase\n* This release doesn't include every planned 2.2.0 feature\n* I kinda rushed releasing it, but didn't\n  * A good amount of changes have been made, and I'm happy releasing them\n  * The development pace will be slower from now on, because I have a life outside Minecraft\n\n## Recommendations\n\n* Recommended for individuals, who like testing (and breaking) stuff\n* Recommended to try for resource pack creators (please create a new profile)\n* Not recommended for everyday users\n* Not recommended for modpacks\n* Documentation is available on [GitHub Pages](https://opekope2.github.io/OptiGUI)\n  * Outdated as of releasing this version, but will update it soon (1-2 weeks from now)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-10T20:22:22.543743Z","downloads":24227,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"cdda9fbe0683eb62b2d911672b018c079ad74d7e","sha512":"245ae4ed738227c4ee90fb3c74cc38bd2791596a519717e1c25aaf24a5bc2ff67459678ccae7a25c94760955bf3eadc16f4d279d6b9b52e9c6cff81565bc161b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/versions/noPVqZnY/optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1.jar","filename":"optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1.jar","primary":true,"size":783917,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"a557149d6cd694c7e861b815032c07ffa734dae8","sha512":"16bcd160913758452e942b7792a4647928b186bad73600fcf2b9dca3433e918821622e7204007f9683039b8190b3e035804ad3f765b13f6d720870b05a279a18"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/versions/noPVqZnY/optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1-api.jar","filename":"optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1-api.jar","primary":false,"size":41859,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"a21186f3e0afd1cc962f2aad42594a90f96db8d5","sha512":"20cb8e0c41c1800a91a7d220b98ec866a9532eb75d94f64d5ec4fe7cdccde554ec18e391613362b2a7b2d121f16eae543523796b09d8d64de27e5786121136a8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/versions/noPVqZnY/optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1-sources.jar","filename":"optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65213,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"PRN43VSY","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Rtp2Lyr5","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LKrNHI7T","user":{"id":"PpKojnYx","username":"opekope2","name":"opekope2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20487556?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-02T09:42:18.771673Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"optigui-2.2.0-alpha.1.jar"},"mods\\blur-3.1.0.jar":{"sha512":"c2e8d0bc87eb8bb5d36f4e980ef1a680e6238043f79553fa13248f6c9d46d18fce209ed57c66e1d1ce7aff04a397dd0ec907c3e07ff02c2c94c20998c6a22768","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NK39zBp2","slug":"blur-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"1VvTWfut","title":"Blur (Fabric)","description":"Adds a blur effect to all GUI backgrounds -

These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\n### Underground Rivers\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\n-----\n\n### Removed Features\n\nPrevious versions of Tectonic included things like custom biomes, trees, and more. These were removed for both performance and compatibility reasons.

Even after the enchanting screen is closed! To put this new capability to good use, enchanting tables will <strong>Render Their Contents</strong> in the world. There are two different rendering modes to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rerolling Enchantments</strong> has become extremely easy. The enchanting screen now has a dedicated button to do just that at a small cost of some lapis lazuli and a few experience points (not full enchantment levels to not ruin your level progress for enchanting as much). Costs are fully configurable and can even be set to completely free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Enchanting tooltips will show not just a single random enchantment, instead they show the <strong>Complete Outcome</strong> of the enchanting process. This feature is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, to enable some basic automation, <strong>Hoppers</strong> can be used to input and output items in the following ways.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Top:</strong> Input for enchantable items</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sides:</strong> Input for lapis lazuli</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bottom:</strong> Output for enchanted items</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And <strong>Comparators</strong> work, too! They will output a signal strength of 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the amount of lapis lazuli items placed in the table.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

several one-handed, two-handed and dual wielded attack animation resources.\n### Accurate weapon collision detection\nNo more pixel hunting with your cursor, you can now just swing your weapon and hit whatever is in the way. Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully

Lib","description":"dynamic data pack and registration, villager activities, custom map marker and a lot more","body":"Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb).

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Lilypad\nCheck out Lilypad if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n----- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ----- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) -----\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":332800,"followers":716,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"r6uVoUxU","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:44:16.042293Z","downloads":169075,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7c6a38565820d9c1941eb9d1aadaae75cb11ed8b","sha512":"892fcccb853e097c3bc11b7205ccd7e99432a6eefee0a6803432d2aa91411eaf0ade9efbd301f5b6991e9efa265cacf67f67518181c3bd2e1ab178e76a4b18c9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/r6uVoUxU/modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":65430,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar"},"mods\\PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar":{"sha512":"e90f182812266c2a4e217f292fc79037612e3eed25dc7894824a3772042c7b0d1908c8df63fb17708ca4de5e86e5972d7a929bc9e4697c6bbfc3e6ea31e50027","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rcTfTZr3","slug":"presence-footsteps","project_type":"mod","team":"GvrerX1T","title":"Presence Footsteps","description":"..An Overly complicated Sound Mod...","body":"_..An Overly complicated Sound Mod..._\n\n---\n\nThis is the continuation of Huricaaan (Ha3)'s original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft.

Modders and users can assign their own materials, sounds, and stance to blocks and entities.","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2023-10-25T10:51:38.493781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1262565,"followers":1683,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.3","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.17-rc1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.2","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"pOCYcZUF","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1","version_number":"1.9.1","changelog":"[Changelog](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.9.1)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-25T10:51:43.881502Z","downloads":3577,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e2c171536c326079b46a1f9c7d115f196dade772","sha512":"e90f182812266c2a4e217f292fc79037612e3eed25dc7894824a3772042c7b0d1908c8df63fb17708ca4de5e86e5972d7a929bc9e4697c6bbfc3e6ea31e50027"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/versions/pOCYcZUF/PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar","filename":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar","primary":true,"size":7283491,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"JBjInUXM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GvrerX1T","user":{"id":"8a7Nm6u3","username":"Sollace","name":"­Sollace","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6429283?v=4","bio":"­","created":"2020-12-01T08:11:42.703275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar"},"mods\\dashloader-5.0.0-beta.2+1.20.0.jar":{"sha512":"103ecdb691e12cce0e59c823fbe2961cb5658f3db844b32ee4295073ee1441ca428fa795785360546d9f4ddd320e3a87ab1abf04d2a549e935b018c4e1f2eb35","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZfQ3kTvR","slug":"dashloader","project_type":"mod","team":"Ea3e9kCo","title":"DashLoader","description":"Launch at the speed of light.","body":"<p style=\"font-family: sans-serif, tahoma, arial, helvetica; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\n    <!-- Features -->\n    <img src=\"https://notalpha.dev/assets/dashloader/features-new.png\" alt=\"Description\"\n         width=\"1000\"/>\n    <br/> This mod accelerates the Minecraft Asset Loading system by caching all\n    of its content, This leads to a much faster game load. It does this by caching all of its content on first launch\n    and on next launch loading back that exact cache. The cache loading is hyper fast and scalable which utilises your\n    entire system. <br/><br/><br/> <strong>Important notes:</strong> <!-- Cache slowdown explanation --> <br/><br/>\n    &bull; The first time your launch DashLoader it will be <strong>significantly slower</strong>. Because it needs to\n    create a cache which contains all the assets minecraft normally loads. This will also happen every time you change a\n    mod/resourcepack if that configuration does not have an existing cache. <!-- Mod compatibility --> <br/><br/> &bull;\n    DashLoader has been known to be incompatible with a lot of mods. DashLoader 3.0 has massively improved compatibility\n    by not forcing mod developers to add explicit support to make their assets cachable. This means that DashLoader will\n    load assets normally for mod assets that cannot be cached. While this improves mod compatibility it hurts speed as\n    the minecraft loading system is quite slow. <!-- Artists --> <br/><br/> &bull; If you use DashLoader for Developing\n    mods or creating resource packs you can press <code>f3 + t</code> to recreate the cache to load your new assets in.\n    If you want to just show off the speed of DashLoader you can press <code>shift + f3 + t</code>

This can significantly improve performance in areas with lots of dropped items, like explosion craters or farms. This mod can be installed on a server without requiring players to install it. It can also be used in singleplayer.\n\n### Config\nThe mod has the following config options: (For Forge: In 1.15+, these config settings can be found in the serverconfig folder of your world's folder)\n\n- **radius** - This is a value from 0.5 to 500 and defines the size of the area in which a dropped item will search for other dropped items to combine with. Example: Setting this to 5.0 will search in an area of 5 blocks (in all directions) around the dropped item. \"0.5\" is vanilla behavior. Do note, that this behavior does not take walls into account.\n- **checkY** - Set this to true if you want dropped items to also check above and below them, set to false if not. \"false\" is vanilla behavior.\n\n### Tags\nThere are also two item tags which can further control the behavior of specific items:\n\n- **getittogetherdrops:do_not_combine** - Items that are added to the tag do not combine at all\n- **getittogetherdrops:ignored** - Items in this tag will be ignored by the mod, and as such fall back to vanilla behavior. This tag takes precedence over *getittogetherdrops:do_not_combine*\n\n### Showcase\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZYvu0Ztz9F0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYou are allowed to use this mod in any modpack.","published":"2022-11-17T13:37:00.113479Z","updated":"2023-06-10T18:01:16.461099Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":17466,"followers":56,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WJuCpwMZ","iQtHmbTD","k3M3Oi9G","qohQWe5n","WZSyXFJr","v3JhWu9o","IPXN2wh9","r7G2ISrg","QnjTocIM","auOM3LYA","ATcsrMNy","csPzTtJp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T0OUgf8P/3c5605a9cb8db314b867a35cc5abe508dd4b53f0.png"},"version":{"id":"ATcsrMNy","project_id":"T0OUgf8P","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":true,"name":"1.20.x-fabric-v1.3.1","version_number":"v1.3.1","changelog":"- Make config accessible through ModMenu","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T09:48:03.985949Z","downloads":3679,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"cdf7f844b1d710cabb41eed13f66b3aab75aaaee","sha512":"f0d1ad74deb3743bead24fb314fc7a25a442fbaaad5ced37455a8f3e4dadcdee57ebe2080fca17735be74825f7ccc4426a264b289ead03417fc57172cb4abca9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T0OUgf8P/versions/ATcsrMNy/getittogetherdrops-fabric-1.20-1.3.1.jar","filename":"getittogetherdrops-fabric-1.20-1.3.1.jar","primary":true,"size":82403,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"y0kQixP8","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"5C5xVEi0","user":{"id":"j2vvv1qU","username":"bl4ckscor3","name":"bl4ckscor3","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/j2vvv1qU/a33ac86ccb684d2fb402233151412018699f1c3c.png","bio":"","created":"2021-06-27T09:17:06.110534Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"getittogetherdrops-fabric-1.20-1.3.1.jar"},"resourcepacks\\Better Foliage §lAdd-On v1.0.zip":{"sha512":"8fbd2e95b7c707617d0c1b3055b9e3944116c974a422fbffac0ac248cdce9ce59ebe286bc123cb84a7011270179be1209f5263c85880f827679226b3e9601c3e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"dJd2FHNx","slug":"better-foliage-add-on","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"gwHF8YJ3","title":"Better Foliage Add-on","description":"A pack that enhances lily pads and vines and make flowers look 3D in hand","body":"# Better Foliage Add-on\n> A pack that enhances lily pads and vines and make flowers look 3D in hand.  \n\n## 📝 ResourcePack Features\n- Improves the model and the texture of the Vines  \n- Makes Lilypads 3D with 8 variants including 7 with flowers  \n- Changes the display of the flowers to see them \"3D\" in hand  \n## Lilypads  \nLilypads will randomly have the flowers of the following colors  \n- Light Blue  \n- Magenta  \n- Orange  \n- Pink  \n- Red  \n- White  \n## 3D Flowers  \n- Allium  \n- Azure bluet  \n- Blue orchid  \n- Cornflower  \n- Dandelion  \n- Lily of the valley  \n- Tulip (pink, white, red and orange)  \n- Oxeye daisy  \n- Wither rose  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/dJd2FHNx/images/44e37ec18e32e8cfbe7f199d970f40f2ebd5c0d3.png\">  \n\n","published":"2023-01-23T14:14:25.998773Z","updated":"2023-06-11T00:44:54.886103Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":796,"followers":16,"categories":["16x","simplistic","vanilla-like"],"additional_categories":["blocks"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["minecraft"],"versions":["OhWxdBIR","H8dvq6Q4","wIoCTt9g","9qKlgmz5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/dJd2FHNx/3559cc022628ca7e3aa0732f6c596ae2ec6258fb.png"},"version":{"id":"9qKlgmz5","project_id":"dJd2FHNx","author_id":"JpZbZERI","featured":false,"name":"Better Foliage Add-On v1.0 - 1.20","version_number":"1.0","changelog":"# 1.20\n- Updated to 1.20\n- This is only a compatibility update of the original pack for 1.20.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**:<br/>**It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it.

Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**:<br/>**It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**:<br/>**It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Client sided library.** YACL is built for client mods only, making it a smaller size.\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2023-09-28T15:30:26.967460Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":1026617,"followers":1452,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.19.4-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","22w42a","23w05a","23w06a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"3hsIB5yP","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.1+1.20 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.2.1+1.20-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Changes\n\n### Config API\n\n- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.\n  - The serializer should now never be called directly.\n  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class.

Many of it's features are inspired by ItemPhysic, this mod has however been built from the ground up for Fabric.\n\n \n\n## Features\n\n\n - **Fancy Item Rendering**: Items will spin while they fall, at a changing speed depending on how fast they're falling. When on the ground, they'll lay flat and compact stacks\n\n \n\n - **Enhanced Pickup and Tooltips**: You can pick up items by right-clicking them, even from a few blocks away. When looking at one, you'll see it's tooltip rendered below your crosshair.\n\n \n\n - **Item Filter**: The Item Filter is an Item that allows you to finely control which items you want to automatically pick up. You can configure it to use either a white- or blacklist and any items affected by that lsit will require you to explicitly pick them up using either a right-click or by sneaking. You can also globally disable auto-pickup in the config to force everyone to explicitly pick up all items.\n\n \n\n - **Item Throwing**: You can throw items by holding down the drop key for a period of time. The longer you hold it, the further you'll throw it. Items which have a damage modifier on them like Sword and Axes will also deal damage when they hit something after being thrown this way.\n\n \n\n - **Client-Only Mode**: You can use Interactic in a mode where it will automatically disable all server-side features and give you only the enhanced rendering and tooltips.\n\n \n\nAll of these features can be individually toggled in the

src=\"https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/banner.png\">\n\n## Overview\n\nDo a Barrel Roll is a lightweight, fully clientside mod for Fabric that changes \nelytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.\nIt achieves this by redesigning movement with a \ncompletely unlocked camera orientation in mind, \nallowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.\n\nSome subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,\nincluding but not limited to smoothing and banking.\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThe Forge version of this mod will no longer receive any updates.\nThis has to do with my personal preferences and lack of knowledge about Forge,\ndue to which, maintaining a port was severely limiting what I could do with the mod.\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra Roll](https://github.com/Jorbon/cool_elytra) mod by [Jorbon](https://github.com/Jorbon),\nspecifically it's \"realistic mode\".\n\nOriginally ported to Forge by [MehVahdJukaar](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar).\n\nMod icon by

mod.\n\n</center>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod prevents campfires from creating any particles when certain blocks are underneath them. It affects both standard and soul campfires. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is to prevent client-side lag and general annoyance when using large numbers of campfires in farms. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is a client-side mod, it will have no effect if installed on a dedicated server.\n\n<br />\n\nThe default list of blocks that suppress smoke is:\n```json\n\"suppressing_blocks_list\": [\n  \"minecraft:hopper\",\n  \"minecraft:rail\",\n  \"minecraft:activator_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:powered_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:detector_rail\"\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\nBlocks can be added and removed either using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) or by editing '.minecraft/config/smoke_suppression.json'\n\n<br />\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to translate Smoke Suppression (there are only a few lines of text), follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/smoke-suppression/invite/). \n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge.

If it touches the water source, it will become ice!\n - The snow layer will accumulate during a snowstorm!\n - The snow layer will have a thinner bounding box like in the Bedrock edition!\n - Reduce

href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invmovecompats\">CurseForge</a> (Mirror)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThis is a rewrite of the previously separate Forge and Fabric versions.<br>\nMod compatibilities have been moved into an addon mod: [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/media/demo.gif)\n\nEnables moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.\n\nAlso hides the darkened background tint in inventories that don't pause the game.\n\nBoth features can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.\n\nThis mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.<br>\nI take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on Forge/Fabric/Quilt.<br>\nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) on Fabric.<br>\nRequires [Quilted Fabric API / Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) on Quilt.<br>\nFor Fabric, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to be able to open the config screen.<br>\nFor Forge, I also recommend [Game Menu Mod Option](https://modrinth.com/mod/gamemenumodoption) so you can change settings in-game.\n\n## Config (In-game)\n\n#### General:\n- Enable Mod: Enable the entire mod\n- Debug Display: Enables a debug overlay that can help debug compatibility problems.\n\n#### UI Movement:\n- Move In Inventories: Enable movement in inventories<br>\n  There is a keybind you can set to toggle this setting (unbound by default)\n- Allow Jumping: Allow jumping in inventories\n- Sneak Mode: How to handle sneaking in inventories:\n  - Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens Background: How to handle screens that pause the game:\n  - Show = Always show background\n  - ShowSP = Show background in singleplayer, otherwise allow hide\n  - AllowHide = Allow background to be hidden\n\nThe Movement and Background pages also have expandable categories containing toggles for individual inventory types.<br>\nThe base mod only has a category for vanilla inventories. For more mod compatibilities, see [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\nAny screens not handled by installed mod compatibilities are added to the \"Unrecognized UI Types\" section, grouped by modid.\n\n## Usage\n\nFeel free to use in packs if you wish.\n\nThe only official downloads are from the InvMove GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>\nBe careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>\n(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)\n\nThe mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/blob/master/COPYING)","published":"2022-02-20T20:50:17.872579Z","updated":"2023-06-18T23:58:21.059467Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":188563,"followers":633,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g6dHjPlj","Nw08AijY","zSjRFisS","KlCCrdyH","z1wUcYrz","Rowb4urF","FxtmKzFE","nyLttvyA","2PM0Ne3I","mXm80CHn","nc2YXBFR","ZUUyXFpC","KZODMPL5","YglVnx4G","AvfVeby1","aarEmm3o","VgnPhVTW","Clo0PUhb","FlJXgCDA","ODrlrF3Z","whx4cyXm","DjMssqvc","FJ91FXja","O575lNuT","dGo1L388","2tK5XdF0","um5St4s3","u2qv60JQ","sVkuPH9Y","qTu058ya","gn5FSncy","sWRkeaiE","LG7n0kA8","RKDVymOM","UTuW1mu8","RsLNtqpA","H2moqgPv","kzI0tILB","2sYsuomN","1uJ8OF0p","Q59zS7Fb","NudOSeIR","L9gZxJNb","VE4bOg3y","WzbaGwer","pfLgaUxC","hrMnbArx","920571eR","h6ELnOF4","JxGn75dh","vk2Y8XQV","WIXovitR","AE0sDDm3","W5h8ZaUy","kqq0UN1u","6CNOChud"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/7c10ef4460c5b2998dac53a494ec9051851f0e76.png"},"version":{"id":"W5h8ZaUy","project_id":"REfW2AEX","author_id":"U9xrZlQH","featured":false,"name":"v0.8.4 (1.20)","version_number":"1.20-0.8.4-fabric","changelog":"(note: marked as alpha because I did not have time to test every version/loader)\n<br>- Update for 1.20\n<br>- Workaround for issues with certain freecam mods ([gh-19](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/issues/19))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-18T23:58:18.237489Z","downloads":62814,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6a39fe20cb7e8da88ff1bc2ec8149a4f732fa098ed8d07b67dfd4278cebba96124a9986de34874ab077fb76ba51138aa8e650b6487bf1df7bb62dbf447e56e03","sha1":"8151113885920d2d67609dfa8e2fc7ac70a807d8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/versions/W5h8ZaUy/InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Fabric.jar","filename":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":124710,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"s7VTKfLA","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"1rXrl5vy","user":{"id":"U9xrZlQH","username":"PieKing1215","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13819558?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-05-27T06:09:15.544829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Fabric.jar"},"resourcepacks\\VanillaTweaks.zip":{"sha512":"858eebbfd584ee2e03c97a88ce9946bfc0bd89cc52f1470902d8fd1013db77c33315fcf61797ebb2827057d5a7a98144003e3b1d03d9cf8303a30d3c7245bcac","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":null,"description":null,"authors":[],"version":null,"icon":"C:\\Users\\prple\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\c727596fde53d534cba86c0f391f2baf38403c6f.png","project_type":"resourcepack"},"file_name":"VanillaTweaks.zip"},"mods\\reeses_sodium_options-1.6.5+mc1.20.1-build.95.jar":{"sha512":"8f0e96ebf0d8f114f789b644b8360fce2fc260716af2b69ea352e96f01e0f4f2871ec0eb4b7f279f2b90117e30c55fa851eca3e39353fdebe03bfca7d2962c3a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Bh37bMuy","slug":"reeses-sodium-options","project_type":"mod","team":"MlZUm0f7","title":"Reese's Sodium Options","description":"Alternative Options Menu for Sodium","body":"Replaces Sodium's Options Screen with intention of improving UX\n\n \n\n# Features\n- Search Bar.\n- Slider values can be changed while holding down `SHIFT` key and scrolling.\n- Scrollable Tabs\n- Scrollable Pages (Overall better UX when using with Sodium Extra).\n- Iris Shader Pack Button.\n \n\n# Screenshot\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/KBsXRBI.png)\n\n![image2](https://i.imgur.com/UjVSMcC.png)\n\n\n# Requirements\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)\n\n\n#### Please do not go and ask CaffeineMC to support this.

and works automatically with any stair/slab or any carpet combination, modded ones included.\n\nTo get a carpet stair simply place a carpet item on any upward facing stair block.\n\nTo remove it just break the block normally.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

Lastly I've made some other quality of life changes relating to the bundle as well, which are specified under 'Features'.\n\n## Features\n- Right-clicking with a bundle will place a random block from the bundle\n- Throwing out all items now requires holding shift\n- If your bundle runs out of a block, it checks your inventory if you have more of that item and automatically refills your bundle\n- If that's not the case, you'll get a message saying, you've run out of that block\n- Bundle can now be dyed with near infinite colour combinations using the vanilla colouring system\n- Adds a recipe for the bundle, using either leather or rabbit hide\n- Rabbits now have the possibility to get up to 3 babies when breeding them, making it easier to get rabbit hide (You monster!)\n- Readded the bundle to the creative inventory under 'Tools'\n\n## Future Plans\n- Compatibility with ['Cauldron Dyeing'](https://modrinth.com/mod/cauldron-dyeing)\n- Making bundles spawn in loot chests\n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"35%\"/>](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/)","published":"2022-07-27T11:00:37.713199Z","updated":"2023-09-01T18:49:03.422845Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1611,"followers":35,"categories":["equipment","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["TUlY0Buy","Advsljh5","W2AsPdtc","BBDgJieZ","fWiczOBf","ALXWRAxT","KvbiA9OF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DPswGlhM/2e2cb6565a2afb35b60760f180387d3b14e0ec78.png"},"version":{"id":"ALXWRAxT","project_id":"DPswGlhM","author_id":"KH4jdxhM","featured":true,"name":"1.0.2-mc1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.2-mc1.20.1","changelog":"- Added translations\n  - Russian (by mpustovoi)\n  - German (by me)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-01T18:48:44.013771Z","downloads":457,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b56aa343623e76eaa4ba08f775c4676be9dd82b3dc811acf9b9597b7f3a25929b37fe765c14d2f578e0a95fd52a098f0ed9b028096232a8a483c14fed1b00d2c","sha1":"d22a6b32f5365dd4edc0e8961f8066c365c3efe3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DPswGlhM/versions/ALXWRAxT/bundle_jumble-1.0.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"bundle_jumble-1.0.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":30490,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"be0a0171ea310897f98c892d27824f88ead30fc5","sha512":"9f55381fe8deeec9a44459e02c06b921bd597c27d6607cd835e9418a8c6d6d6627e1a568e51aa21bbe3fbdf6f8b2af8c7ed47a2ba7bb6782392934bc66e49e3e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DPswGlhM/versions/ALXWRAxT/bundle_jumble-1.0.2-mc1.20.1-sources.jar","filename":"bundle_jumble-1.0.2-mc1.20.1-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":22422,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"3v6YrY3h","user":{"id":"KH4jdxhM","username":"Strubbelkopp","name":"Strubbelkopp","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66599825?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-15T22:29:12.823446Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"bundle_jumble-1.0.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"resourcepacks\\VanillaTweaks_r937349.zip":{"sha512":"a8de842722c8486eb14368c6e5f0949b2a007db248b11d568186960b14510786ed1ee970ccb4d31753ab9299e230ecd9bef9f68a9bfee3cc6c2ee571001b61ab","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":null,"description":null,"authors":[],"version":null,"icon":"C:\\Users\\prple\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\c727596fde53d534cba86c0f391f2baf38403c6f.png","project_type":"resourcepack"},"file_name":"VanillaTweaks_r937349.zip"},"mods\\ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uXXizFIs","slug":"ferrite-core","project_type":"mod","team":"2JhABx1f","title":"FerriteCore","description":"Memory usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-10-22T13:40:13.622385Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1694048,"followers":3560,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":true,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":22376,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\nounusedchunks-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"725eec752a7f9845d28a89e6e7500b101377e4112d531340ad265b7750f910392e7c33e28257fc7cb605496e6bf350b459ac2c80dd55258244d1407672e0ea7b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"U8avpWmO","slug":"no-unused-chunks","project_type":"mod","team":"D1OFKTK2","title":"No Unused Chunks","description":"A Minecraft mod that reduces world size by discarding unused chunks.","body":"<ins>**Regarding 1.19.3 and going forward:**</ins> Many changes were made to the game with the release of 1.19.3, and Mojang has stated that they may bring new features in \"patch\" (1.x.x) releases now, and not just \"minor\" (1.x) releases. As such, please avoid using this mod on versions it does not specify it supports, as it could lead to crashes and (possible?) damage to world files (depends on the Minecraft update).\n\n##\nThis Minecraft mod reduces world size by discarding unused chunks.\n \n<ins><b>Important</b></ins>: Please back-up your world if you are planning on using this mod on an already existing world.\nThis mod shouldn't cause any issues, but it is still a good idea to back-up worlds, just in case.\n\n### How to use this mod:\n1. Go to the world selection screen\n2. Select a world of your choice\n3. Click on the \"Edit\" button\n4. Click on the \"Optimize World\" button\n5. There should be a checkbox called \"Remove uninhabited chunks\". Check it it.\n6. Click on \"Create backup and Load\". This will back-up your world just in case something goes wrong.\n7. That's it. It's best to also verify everything went to plan and that no data loss took place.\n\n## How well does the mod do?\nI performed a few tests in Minecraft 1.18.2 by generating an 18x18 chunk area with 18 render distance in a few worlds with and without the mod. I then measured the world sizes after each chunk generation to see what the world size was after generating was done.\n```cs\n------------------------------------------------\n# Default (18x18) (100% unflag) (Seed: -4665624743998437880)\n- Without mod: ~23.9 MB\n- With mod:    ~14.4 MB\n- Saved:       ~9.5  MB (-39.75%)\n------------------------------------------------\n# Default (18x18) (100% unflag) (Seed: 2419730229291416458)\n- Without mod: ~24   MB\n- With mod:    ~14.4 MB\n- Saved:       ~9.6  MB (-40%)\n------------------------------------------------\n# Superflat (18x18) (no features) (no entities) (100% unflag) (Seed: idk)\n- Without mod: ~15.5 MB\n- With mod:    ~6.25 MB\n- Saved:       ~9.25 MB (-59.7%)\n------------------------------------------------\n# Amplified (18x18) (100% unflag) (Seed: -2757405298360622893)\n- Without mod: ~25.5 MB\n- With mod:    ~15.8 MB\n- Saved:       ~9.7  MB (-38.04%)\n------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n### Important notice:\n- The game keeps track of which chunks players have interacted with using a special variable called \"InhabitedTime\". Whenever a player enters a chunk or does something to a chunk, the value of \"InhabitedTime\" increases. The way this feature works is by going through every chunk in every region file of a given world, and removing all chunks whose \"InhabitedTime\" value is set to \"0\". This means that any and all chunks whose \"InhabitedTime\" is \"0\" will get removed. It is important to keep in mind that if you used a creative tool/mod/program to modify chunks without ever entering them as an in-game player and making changes to them manually, or if the game fails to keep track of \"InhabitedTime\", there is a high chance those chunks will get removed anyways. Always back up your worlds before doing this, and immediately make sure no chunks you needed somehow got removed.\n- If there are any issues/bugs or if you do spot this mod's feature removing chunks it isn't suppoed to remove, please let me know so I can see if something can be done to resolve it.\n\n## A showcase of removing unused chunks\nThis video (click on the image) shows how the mod can be used to remove \"uninhabited\" chunks to reduce world size:</br>\n[![No Unused Chunks showcase](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Bo2mNGJsSuo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo2mNGJsSuo)\n\n##\n<p align=center>\n  <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-unused-chunks\"><img alt=\"CurseForge\" src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/645755.svg\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/U8avpWmO\"><img alt=\"Modrinth\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/U8avpWmO?label=Modrinth\"></a>\n</p>","published":"2022-07-17T12:46:25.314800Z","updated":"2023-06-25T14:00:21.830641Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":29329,"followers":160,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["dwSADPX3","1GbzZoyb","7JQh7xVu","yhKko6lW","5LWSU5UV","h7d8Ahr1","tujat67u","RSwDbz7i","CiTcfdxG","aEu0TBEG","obkxrqRQ","XypL6UW9","QcGaX6Yy","IMVegkvR","B1ITmI5k","znO6mqTW","LwiSqK7n","LpJZEoBp","GPTZMhxs","3iiQMpXR","ILRXywIW","2EYsfcMk","8J8ZE8MA","V2wuvNea","jrPCINcq","kovBDLz3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U8avpWmO/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"8J8ZE8MA","project_id":"U8avpWmO","author_id":"j0Ha6a2h","featured":false,"name":"NUC (fabric-1.20.1) - v2.0","version_number":"v2.0+fabric-1.19.4","changelog":"- Ported to fabric-1.19.4.\n- Did not port (aka removed) the \"automatic chunk discarding\" feature.\n- Did not port (aka removed) the \"automatic chunk discarding config\" feature.\n- Did port (aka kept) the feature for removing existing chunks from the \"Optimize world\" menu screen\n- This mod is now 100% client-side-only.\n\nThe reason the \"automatic chunk discarding\" was not kept is because I often saw it beeing seen as a \"deoptimization\" feature (which is true) that isn't worth sacrificing performance over, just to save some drive storage. In other words, trading server/single-player performance for storage space might not be worth it. Oh and, if you're wondering if it's possible to get this remaining feature to work on servers, well.. I'm not even gonna try, as it's not only too difficult for me to pull off, but it's also \"unintended\" behavor from the game's perspective (which ofc. can cause world corruptions and errors, so no, not doing that).\n\n<ins>**Important:**</ins> Minecraft has one **massive flaw**. When \"optimizing\" worlds (and removing unused chunks), **Minecraft loads the entire worlds into memory (RAM)**. If you have a huge world, and not enough RAM to fit it, then this could be a big problem for you.

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1312287,"followers":2906,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

message...\n\n**This mod is the result of thousands of hours of development, and is made possible thanks to players like you.** If you would like to show a token of your appreciation for our work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying us a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n---\n\nSodium is a **free and open-source** mod for Minecraft 1.16+ clients which greatly improves rendering performance while fixing some graphical issues. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow. Many of our players report a **250% to 500% increase** in average frame rates.\n\n- AMD Ryzen 5 5600H / NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142405940545585233/2023-08-19_12.24.14.png) 34 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142405941036331019/2023-08-19_12.27.45.png) 253 fps) [7.4x faster]\n- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 / NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141912049392296046/2023-08-17_21.46.37.png) 62 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141912050084347914/2023-08-17_21.48.26.png) 516 fps) [8.3x faster]\n- Intel Xeon E5-1620v3 / AMD RX 6400 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235253193318441/2023-08-19_00.50.49.png) 52 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235253738586234/2023-08-19_01.14.25.png) 216 fps) [4.1x faster]\n- AMD Ryzen 3450U / AMD Vega 8 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141919288047976448/2023-08-17_22.15.37.png) 49 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1141919288542892254/2023-08-17_22.18.12.png) 118 fps) [2.4x faster]\n- Intel Core i5-11400 / Intel UHD 730 Graphics ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235069117890731/2023-08-19_05.07.07.png) 39 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142235069747048511/2023-08-19_04.55.38.png) 110 fps) [2.8x faster]\n- Intel Core i3-4170 / NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142286136782372984/2023-08-19_10.27.03.png) 38 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142286137050791986/2023-08-19_10.23.28.png) 86 fps) [2.2x faster]\n- Intel Celeron G5900 / Intel UHD Graphics 610 ([before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142299880228925530/2023-08-18_23.10.08.png) 62 fps, [after](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1141899838200483981/1142299880656736337/2023-08-18_23.08.18.png) 155 fps) [2.5x faster]\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Fud5oyF.png))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison above water](https://i.imgur.com/z9HBcvq.png), [comparison below water](https://i.imgur.com/QQMuOTy.png).) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://i.imgur.com/lYmlmgq.png)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...","published":"2021-01-28T16:09:11.540414Z","updated":"2023-10-07T18:30:00.838073Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":455322,"followers":1638,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","21w41a"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Lz5UGUqe","qBn758ZA","xQRdGvDT","QTn4WxFz","Vx5ygkPc","mqyNUioD","gqfXCbT3","oHAko2xm","RdpuJfjg","a7SgCh8W","KlJ03K3I","FaCaUOFs","jPEjJST0","dWryIdUY","uFJKVYDV","XiehU3ne","7bo5KA2S","aufE28Na","nlfT2jHV","SjhvzbUC","n7dcLucW","bSrG4Fxf","ZMbS4EYg","XYq90g2b","OSEfdzSy","HMfGMPn2","8qK6ANpJ","mva7rKdl","KpvXCE2X"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/icon.gif"},"version":{"id":"KpvXCE2X","project_id":"WhbRG4iK","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.15.4","version_number":"1.15.4","changelog":"add an option to turn off \"block breaking leaves\" (on-hit and on-decay) on a per-block basis","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-07T18:30:04.660427Z","downloads":74913,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5101bd05c678a874c1fa40c3363d1c127f7074d5","sha512":"60bdf742d75a7836809087fed4e92da23dd24a09a2f222e5d2807a0fe6f1dfeff9c42c1a3cb84d20d93b3c8045b349f805d3b7b4eee4278dfe5bfe3b9bd2ebc1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/versions/KpvXCE2X/fallingleaves-1.15.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"fallingleaves-1.15.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":153985,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"n4QH7y5y","username":"BrekiTomasson","name":"Breki Tomasson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7026735?v=4","bio":"- Lead developer at TankerTrackers.com \r\n- Always juggling 20-something programming projects \r\n- <3 clean code & good code hygiene.\r\n- Java, PHP, NodeJS","created":"2021-01-28T07:40:11.099939Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"GHOKC5y2","username":"randommcsomethin","name":"Adam Malkovitch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34224353?v=4","bio":"Chief Egg Officer of the refridgerator","created":"2021-03-22T20:48:30.163379Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fallingleaves-1.15.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\wthit-fabric-8.4.0.jar":{"sha512":"dd5d48584222623012d59922112c4785d2bf218ef5f8ab5e3a211d15a1a8f017fbff5e529880ca173b9976e8d52a645fd3184961efca0d5ea14b783790b50eae","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"6AQIaxuO","slug":"wthit","project_type":"mod","team":"8SulWj9L","title":"WTHIT","description":"What the hell is that?","body":"# What The Hell Is That?\n\n[![fabric-api](https://images2.imgbox.com/8e/38/bfInI5qv_o.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n[![badpackets](https://images2.imgbox.com/1b/01/DfkvHGbQ_o.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/badpackets)\n\n> _“I am no longer interested in modding.”_\n> \\- TehNut\n\nHwyla is 🦀!!1 Now how the hell I can play Minecraft??!!1!    \nDon't worry, ladies and gentlemen, I got you covered!\n\nIntroducing WTHIT - a fork of [HWYLA](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/hwyla) by [TehNut](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tehnut), which is itself is a fork of [WAILA](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/waila) by [ProfMobius](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/ProfMobius)    \nWTHIT is a mod that adds an ingame tooltip with information about what block (or fluid) the player is looking at.\n\n![Touch some grass](https://images2.imgbox.com/24/15/jsEUqMnF_o.png)\n\nIt also has an API for other mod to add more info about their blocks.\n\n### Does WTHIT work with plugin X?\nOf course, although make sure to use Fabric Loader 0.11+.\n\n### Does it work with [insert minor version]?\nProbably.

except Better End\n- Do not add this to an existing end - reset yours first, or use a new world\n- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)\n\n## Description\nNullscape will make you feel tiny and alone in the vast expanse of the End. You against the void - nothing more than that.\nNullscape boosts the End's height to 384 blocks, and makes full use of 1.18's modern features to generate incredibly varied terrain. You'll find everything from shattered islands, to floating valleys, to crystallized peaks! Different regions of the End - on very large scales - have different properties and feelings to allow for almost infinite variation in terrain shapes. From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n","published":"2022-11-23T00:37:43.847598Z","updated":"2023-09-24T19:47:53.764014Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":42165,"followers":342,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["qgcEh2CX","krUi6WMq","qFzFO6Ir","oN3IWKBO","Z04FxO0c","2Oo6cuEV","aDm1dD3Q","uXfroGYN","M1tAEtbt","tM4b5n8e","O0uQyKki","w4mEZnbU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LPjGiSO4/b6a7489ca6a0fd553870f9d1c24224d0555232d3.png"},"version":{"id":"w4mEZnbU","project_id":"LPjGiSO4","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.2.3 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"1.2.3","changelog":"# Nullscape v1.2.3\n- Works on all 1.20.x versions!\n- Uses the new Multi-versioned `pack.mcmeta` introduced in 1.20.2 (thank you Mojang)\n- Pretty-ified datapack description\n- Updated biome colors and structure icons to new standard for [Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/) and [World Preview](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-preview/)\n- Added a couple Fabric/Forge tags\n- Removed some unused structures to reduce confusion with `/locate`","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-24T19:47:55.506637Z","downloads":11167,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6d0d32276415eb11b4c58f7ccd61145aa83095e4","sha512":"62359d5d286128509a652cb47f55ba4bbb68d0c3618d51077a928828811e74fafddf263fae18ae66e26f4c670fcfc97238a5077a34ae8b7e1a2f0b31db785639"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LPjGiSO4/versions/w4mEZnbU/Nullscape_1.20.2_v1.2.3.jar","filename":"Nullscape_1.20.2_v1.2.3.jar","primary":true,"size":318199,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oJIBNZ9Y","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

Access them from the [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) menu.\n- Iris shader support* (known compatibilites [here](https://github.com/Goby56/wakes/blob/main/shader_compat.md))\n\n### Future\n- Splash particles at the front of the boat\n- Optine shader support\n\nThe mod is in early development and can therefore be lacking in some areas.

Clients don't need to install it to connect to servers using the mod. It also works in single-player. \n\n</center>\n\n---\n\n## Wither Cage Fix\n\nThis mod fixes a bug in vanilla minecraft that causes Wither bosses to forget which mob they were targeting when they unload (due to quitting, going through a portal, etc. ).\n\nAdditionally, it adds a new gamerule: `allowBlueWitherSkulls` (default = true, vanilla behavior).\nIf this is set to false, Withers will never shoot blue skulls (whenever they would have, they'll shoot normal skulls instead).\n\nThe bug fix allows for much simpler Wither cages because there's no need to control line-of-sight when entering/leaving the area.\n\nThe gamerule is added as an option because blue Wither skulls have basically no purpose other than to make Wither cages more difficult to create.\n\nWhy would anyone want a caged Wither?\n- They provide a fully-automatable, late-game ([subjectively] balanced) way of breaking blocks.\n- The above is a nice alternative to TNT duping for those who don't want to use it (also check out [Carpet TIS Addition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet-tis-addition) which includes an optional patch for TNT duping).\n- It's cool.\n\n---\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license is [MIT](https://will-lucic.mit-license.org/), however, so anyone else is free to port it.\n\nI'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links aren't required.","published":"2021-06-07T05:27:58.776631Z","updated":"2023-06-24T06:06:18.243172Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":3242,"followers":29,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.17-rc1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["nvBMw3sN","Z5X6onZX","xgveocFm","LVUkQz8N","UGtl88WH","cdNqPQqv","txvYPXDy","QAmia3Ds","IbzTntPL","vQP5t4RJ","ilbnBrdP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8tiZuCBJ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ilbnBrdP","project_id":"8tiZuCBJ","author_id":"LxSEd81o","featured":false,"name":"1.0.17+MC1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.17+MC1.20-1.20.1","changelog":" Updated for 1.20 and 1.20.1!\n\nA cumulative changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/supersaiyansubtlety/wither_cage_fix/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T06:06:18.778421Z","downloads":1034,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b1de707652063b257f93b8881c5eec14ec7e62a0","sha512":"a4746eb9f1658262559944f8e0150bf644451de2801b9706d4238cbc12d17346565a4ff6872f0564768384bb6a369742a53d10d3755bc5d322ccb66fdd3af913"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8tiZuCBJ/versions/ilbnBrdP/wither-cage-fix-1.0.17%2BMC1.20-1.20.1.jar","filename":"wither-cage-fix-1.0.17+MC1.20-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":15264,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"tWqYUp91","user":{"id":"LxSEd81o","username":"supersaiyansubtlety","name":"Will","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/618276?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-14T17:10:51.649412Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"wither-cage-fix-1.0.17+MC1.20-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Couplings-1.9.4+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"f2969fa7823a4d0b9d8042bb52df792e47291ef7ef166fbce3c659094c0f96587ad4ff799ebfd89475ba17665a89b84f4b34a7b5c541199c167962666da2c7dd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"80ulerjA","slug":"couplings","project_type":"mod","team":"6pBlDaaY","title":"Couplings","description":"Coupled usage of doors, fence gates, and trapdoors","body":"Coupled usage of doors, fence gates, and trapdoors\n\n- Double doors (with opposing hinges) will open together when used\n- Vertically stacked fence gates will open together when used\n- All trapdoors (and opposing counterparts) along their side axes will open together when used\n- Any redstone signal above 7 (50%) will power all coupled blocks, whereas anything less will only power the immediate block \n- Each coupled block can be individually toggled in the configuration file (./config/couplings.toml)\n\n**This mod is recommended on both the client and server for more responsive block updates**\n\nLogo design by [@voxel_dani](https://twitter.com/voxel_dani)","published":"2022-07-25T19:56:38.693906Z","updated":"2023-07-14T03:16:17.597923Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":33303,"followers":149,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["QgoO6wsd","zKjA428p","cOTJKyN0","zjKCIfjh","v92fiDeM","1S2TEbqR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/80ulerjA/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"1S2TEbqR","project_id":"80ulerjA","author_id":"p6EaKDNZ","featured":true,"name":"1.9.4+1.20","version_number":"1.9.4+1.20","changelog":" -

This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.
